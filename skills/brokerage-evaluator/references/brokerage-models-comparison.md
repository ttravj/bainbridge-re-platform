| **Cons** | Higher splits for most agents, no cap at many offices, franchise fees add to cost, technology can lag behind cloud competitors, culture depends entirely on the local office |

### 1.6 RE/MAX

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model Type** | High-Split / Desk Fee |
| **Split Structure** | Historically 95/5 to 100% after desk fees. Modern structure varies: some offices are now 80/20 or 70/30 with lower desk fees. The "100% concept" still exists but with monthly fees that effectively create a split. |
| **Cap** | Varies by office -- some have caps, many do not |
| **Monthly Fees** | $500-$2,500+/month desk fees (covers office space, technology, support staff, brand). This is the primary cost at RE/MAX. |
| **Per-Transaction Fees** | $100-$500+ per transaction |
| **Technology Provided** | Varies by franchise -- some offices provide CRM, marketing tools, and website; others provide minimal technology |
| **Training** | RE/MAX University, varies by office. Some offices invest heavily in training; others are primarily desk-fee-collection operations. |
| **Revenue Share** | None |
| **Stock/Equity** | None (RE/MAX Holdings is publicly traded, but no agent equity program) |
| **Brand Strength** | Very strong global brand (balloon logo is highly recognized); strong in many local markets |
| **Culture** | "Everybody wins" positioning. Attracts self-sufficient, experienced agents. Less collaborative than KW; more independent. |
| **Best For** | Established producers who want maximum split and are willing to pay desk fees, agents in markets where RE/MAX has dominant share, agents who value brand and autonomy |
| **Pros** | High split or near-100%, strong brand recognition globally, referral network, autonomy, agents keep most of what they earn |
| **Cons** | High monthly desk fees create real fixed costs regardless of production (dangerous for slow months), technology and training vary dramatically by office, model favors high producers -- low producers can pay more in desk fees than they earn, less support than training-focused brands |

### 1.7 Century 21

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model Type** | Traditional / Split-Based |
| **Split Structure** | Typically 50/50 to 70/30 depending on production and franchise |

| **Stock/Equity** | None |
| **Brand Strength** | Strong legacy brand; recognized by consumers, especially in suburban/mid-market areas |

| **Pros** | Recognized brand, established training in good offices, referral network, generally reasonable entry-level splits |
| **Cons** | Splits can be high (50/50 is common for new agents), no cap at most offices, technology can lag, model rewards tenure more than production at some franchises, franchise fees passed through |

### 1.8 Redfin

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model Type** | Salaried / Discount |
| **Split Structure** | Not a traditional split. Agents are employees (W-2) with base salary + per-transaction bonus. Total compensation is typically 30-50% of what a traditional commission agent would earn on the same volume. |
| **Cap** | N/A (salary model) |
| **Monthly Fees** | None (employee model) |
| **Per-Transaction Fees** | None (employee model) |
| **Technology Provided** | Full Redfin tech stack (CRM, search, marketing, transaction management) |
| **Training** | Structured corporate training program |
| **Revenue Share** | None |
| **Stock/Equity** | Employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) available; Redfin (RDFN) publicly traded |
| **Brand Strength** | Strong consumer brand among online-first buyers/sellers; perception of "discount" |
| **Culture** | Corporate, structured, metrics-driven. Not entrepreneurial. |
| **Best For** | Agents who want predictable income, health benefits, and structured hours; agents transitioning into or out of the industry; agents who prefer employment over self-employment |

| **Cons** | Dramatically lower earning potential, limited autonomy, brand perceived as discount, no ability to build personal brand or SOI on Redfin's platform, employee classification limits flexibility, company has had significant layoffs |

### 1.9 Boutique / Independent

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model Type** | Varies -- negotiated between agent and broker/owner |
| **Split Structure** | Negotiable: 60/40 to 90/10 depending on production, relationship, and what the brokerage provides |
| **Cap** | Some offer caps; many do not |
| **Monthly Fees** | $0-$500+/month -- varies widely |
| **Per-Transaction Fees** | $0-$500 -- varies widely |
| **Technology Provided** | Varies widely from full tech stack to "bring your own everything" |
| **Training** | Varies from excellent (broker-led, personalized) to nonexistent |
| **Revenue Share** | Rare |
| **Stock/Equity** | Rare (some offer partnership/ownership paths) |
| **Brand Strength** | Local only; no national recognition |
| **Culture** | Highly personal; often the broker/owner's personality defines the culture. Can be the best culture in the industry or the worst. |
| **Best For** | Agents who value personal relationships with their broker, agents in markets where independent brands are respected, agents who want negotiation flexibility, agents transitioning to hanging their own license |
| **Pros** | Negotiable terms, direct broker access, flexibility, personal culture, potential for ownership path, often lower overhead than national brands |
| **Cons** | No national referral network, limited brand recognition, technology and training quality depend entirely on the broker/owner, risk of brokerage instability if owner retires/exits, compliance infrastructure may be minimal |

## 2. Side-by-Side Comparison Table

| Feature | KW | eXp | Real | Compass | CB | RE/MAX | C21 | Redfin | Boutique |
|---------|-----|------|------|---------|-----|--------|------|--------|----------|
| **Base Split** | 64/36* | 80/20 | 85/15 | ~80/20 negotiated | 60-70/30-40 | 95-100%** | 50-70/30-50 | Salary | Negotiated |

| **Monthly Fees** | $85+ | $110 | ~$42 | $0-200 | $0-500 | $500-2,500 | $0-300 | None | $0-500 |
| **Transaction Fees** | $0-250 | $250 pre-cap / $75 post | $149 | $0-500 | $100-500 | $100-500 | $100-500 | None | $0-500 |
| **Revenue Share** | Profit share | 7-tier rev share | 5-tier rev share | No | No | No | No | No | Rare |
| **Stock/Equity** | Evolving | EXPI stock awards | REAX stock awards | Reduced | No | No | No | ESPP | Rare |
| **Physical Office** | Yes | No (virtual) | No (virtual) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Varies |
| **Training Quality*** | Excellent | Good (virtual) | Developing | Inconsistent | Good (varies) | Varies | Good (varies) | Structured | Varies |
| **Tech Provided** | KWCOMMAND | kvCORE + suite | reZEN | Compass platform | CB Suite | Varies | C21 Suite | Full stack | Varies |
| **Brand Recognition** | Strong (agents) | Growing | Newer | Strong (luxury) | Very strong | Very strong | Strong | Strong (online) | Local only |
| **Best Career Stage** | New-Developing | Producing-Top | Producing-Top | Producing (luxury) | New-Developing | Top Producer | New-Developing | Any (different goals) | Varies |

*KW split is 64% to agent / 30% to market center / 6% franchise royalty, so the agent effective split is 64%.
**RE/MAX splits are high but offset by desk fees that can exceed $1,000-$2,000/month.
***Training quality ratings are generalizations; individual office quality varies significantly within every brand.

## 3. Take-Home Modeling by Production Level

Assumptions for all models:
- Average commission rate: 2.5% of volume
- "Take-home after brokerage" = GCI minus all brokerage costs (split, cap, monthly fees, transaction fees)
- Transaction count estimated at $400K average sale price
- Does not include business expenses or taxes (see `financial-performance` skill for full waterfall)

### 3.1 Scenario A: $3M Volume (~$75K GCI, ~8 transactions)

| Brokerage Model | Split Cost | Cap Applied | Monthly Fees | Transaction Fees | Total Brokerage Cost | Agent Take-Home | Effective Split |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **KW** (64/30/6, $22K cap) | $27,000* | No (under cap) | $1,020 | $0 | $28,020 | $46,980 | 62.6% |
| **eXp** (80/20, $16K cap) | $15,000 | No (under cap) | $1,320 | $2,000 | $18,320 | $56,680 | 75.6% |
| **Real** (85/15, $12K cap) | $11,250 | No (under cap) | $500 | $1,192 | $12,942 | $62,058 | 82.7% |
| **Compass** (~80/20, no cap) | $15,000 | No cap | $1,200 | $1,600 | $17,800 | $57,200 | 76.3% |
| **CB** (70/30, no cap) | $22,500 | No cap | $2,400 | $1,600 | $26,500 | $48,500 | 64.7% |
| **RE/MAX** (95/5 + desk) | $3,750 | N/A | $18,000 | $2,000 | $23,750 | $51,250 | 68.3% |
| **C21** (60/40, no cap) | $30,000 | No cap | $1,200 | $1,600 | $32,800 | $42,200 | 56.3% |
| **Boutique** (75/25, no cap) | $18,750 | No cap | $1,200 | $800 | $20,750 | $54,250 | 72.3% |

*KW: $75K x 36% = $27,000 (under the ~$22K cap because of the 64/36 effective split -- the agent has not yet paid enough to reach cap).

**Key Takeaway at $3M:** Real Broker is the cheapest. RE/MAX desk fees are punishing at low production. Traditional splits (C21 60/40, CB 70/30) take a large bite. New agents should weigh training value heavily -- the $15K-$20K cost difference between the cheapest and most expensive options may be justified by better training and mentorship at this production level.

### 3.2 Scenario B: $6M Volume (~$150K GCI, ~15 transactions)

| Brokerage Model | Split Cost | Cap Applied | Monthly Fees | Transaction Fees | Total Brokerage Cost | Agent Take-Home | Effective Split |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **KW** ($22K cap) | $22,000 | Yes (capped) | $1,020 | $0 | $23,020 | $126,980 | 84.7% |
| **eXp** ($16K cap) | $16,000 | Yes (capped) | $1,320 | $4,875* | $22,195 | $127,805 | 85.2% |
| **Real** ($12K cap) | $12,000 | Yes (capped) | $500 | $2,235 | $14,735 | $135,265 | 90.2% |
| **Compass** (~80/20, no cap) | $30,000 | No cap | $1,200 | $3,000 | $34,200 | $115,800 | 77.2% |
| **CB** (70/30, no cap) | $45,000 | No cap | $2,400 | $3,000 | $50,400 | $99,600 | 66.4% |
| **RE/MAX** (95/5 + desk) | $7,500 | N/A | $18,000 | $3,750 | $29,250 | $120,750 | 80.5% |
| **C21** (65/35, no cap) | $52,500 | No cap | $1,200 | $3,000 | $56,700 | $93,300 | 62.2% |
| **Boutique** (75/25, no cap) | $37,500 | No cap | $1,200 | $1,500 | $40,200 | $109,800 | 73.2% |

*eXp: $250/transaction pre-cap (first ~$80K GCI = ~10 transactions x $250 = $2,500), then $75/transaction post-cap (~5 transactions x $75 = $375). Plus some residual. Approximate total.

**Key Takeaway at $6M:** Capped models dominate. The spread between the cheapest (Real at $14.7K) and most expensive (C21 at $56.7K) is $42,000/year. Agents at uncapped 70/30 or worse splits are losing $25K-$42K compared to capped alternatives. At this production level, the non-monetary value of any brokerage almost certainly cannot justify a $30K+ annual cost premium.

### 3.3 Scenario C: $10M Volume (~$250K GCI, ~25 transactions)

| Brokerage Model | Split Cost | Cap Applied | Monthly Fees | Transaction Fees | Total Brokerage Cost | Agent Take-Home | Effective Split |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **KW** ($22K cap) | $22,000 | Yes (capped) | $1,020 | $0 | $23,020 | $226,980 | 90.8% |
| **eXp** ($16K cap) | $16,000 | Yes (capped) | $1,320 | $6,375* | $23,695 | $226,305 | 90.5% |
| **Real** ($12K cap) | $12,000 | Yes (capped) | $500 | $3,725 | $16,225 | $233,775 | 93.5% |
| **Compass** (~80/20, no cap) | $50,000 | No cap | $1,200 | $5,000 | $56,200 | $193,800 | 77.5% |
| **CB** (70/30, no cap) | $75,000 | No cap | $2,400 | $5,000 | $82,400 | $167,600 | 67.0% |
| **RE/MAX** (95/5 + desk) | $12,500 | N/A | $18,000 | $6,250 | $36,750 | $213,250 | 85.3% |
| **C21** (65/35, no cap) | $87,500 | No cap | $1,200 | $5,000 | $93,700 | $156,300 | 62.5% |
| **Boutique** (80/20, negotiated) | $50,000 | No cap | $1,200 | $2,500 | $53,700 | $196,300 | 78.5% |

*eXp: $250/transaction x ~10 pre-cap + $75/transaction x ~15 post-cap = $2,500 + $1,125 = $3,625. Plus quarterly fees, approximate.

**Key Takeaway at $10M:** Top producers at uncapped splits are leaving $60K-$77K on the table compared to capped models. The difference between Real ($16.2K total cost) and C21 uncapped ($93.7K) is $77,500/year. At this production level, no amount of training, brand, or office space justifies that gap. Agents producing $10M+ at uncapped splits should either renegotiate aggressively or move to a capped or fee-based model.

## 4. Revenue Share and Equity Program Details

### eXp Realty Revenue Share

**Mechanics:**
- Agents earn a percentage of the "company dollar" (the 20% collected before an agent caps) from agents they directly sponsor (Tier 1) and agents sponsored by their downline (Tiers 2-7).
- Revenue share percentages by tier: Tier 1: 3.5%, Tier 2: 4.0%, Tier 3: 2.5%, Tier 4: 1.5%, Tier 5: 1.0%, Tier 6: 0.5%, Tier 7: 0.5%.
- To be eligible, the sponsoring agent must be an active, producing eXp agent in good standing.
- Revenue share is paid monthly.

**Realistic Income Modeling:**
| Network Size (Tier 1 Direct) | Avg Company Dollar per Agent | Estimated Annual Revenue Share |
|----|------|------|
| 3 agents | $10,000 | $1,050 |
| 10 agents | $10,000 | $3,500 |
| 25 agents | $10,000 | $8,750 |
| 50 agents (with downline) | $10,000 | $20,000-$40,000 |
| 100+ agents (multi-tier) | $10,000 | $50,000-$100,000+ |

Note: $100K+ revenue share requires a very large, active, multi-tier network built over years. This is not typical income and should not be the reason for choosing eXp.

### eXp ICON Agent Program

Agents who meet ICON status criteria (cap, production requirements, cultural contributions) receive their entire cap back in EXPI stock. This effectively makes eXp free for ICON-qualifying agents beyond monthly and transaction fees.

### Real Broker Revenue Share

**Mechanics:**
- 5-tier system on company dollar (15% collected before cap).
- Tier structure and percentages are similar in concept to eXp but on a smaller company dollar base (15% vs. 20%).
- Real also offers stock awards for production milestones and agent attraction.

### Keller Williams Profit Share

**Mechanics:**
- Different from revenue share. KW agents receive a share of their market center's profit (not gross revenue).
- Profit share is allocated based on the agent's contribution to the market center (production) and the agents they have sponsored.
- If the market center is not profitable, there is no profit share to distribute.
- Profit share can be meaningful at well-run, profitable market centers; it is zero at unprofitable ones.

## 5. Career Stage Alignment Matrix

| Career Stage | Top Priority | Second Priority | Recommended Models | Avoid |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **New Agent** (0-2 years) | Training, mentorship, deal support | Reasonable cost at low production | KW (BOLD/Ignite), strong CB/C21 office, mentorship-focused boutique | Cloud brokerages without mentorship, RE/MAX desk fees with no production, any brokerage that says "training is online" |
| **Developing** (2-4 years, 8-18 txn) | Systems, technology, balanced cost | Professional development, lead gen help | KW (approaching cap), eXp (if self-motivated), Compass (if luxury), strong boutique | High-split uncapped (paying 30%+ indefinitely), any model where fees exceed value |
| **Producing** (3-7 years, 18-30 txn) | Competitive total cost, hitting cap | Good technology, operational freedom | eXp, Real, KW (at cap), negotiated boutique, RE/MAX (if desk fees reasonable) | Uncapped 70/30 or worse, any model where total cost exceeds $30K/year without proportional value |
| **Top Producer** (5+ years, 30+ txn) | Maximum take-home | Autonomy, compliance support | Real, eXp, fee-based, KW (well past cap), negotiated boutique (85+/15 or better) | Uncapped splits (leaving $40-80K+ on table), any model not justified by economics |
| **Team Leader** | Team infrastructure, compliance, per-agent economics | Recruiting tools, brand | KW (team-friendly), eXp (team models), Compass (luxury teams), strong boutique | Models that charge excessive per-agent fees, models without team commission processing, models that limit team structure |
| **Broker/Owner** | Full independence, scalable P&L | Compliance tools, agent attraction | Own brokerage (virtual or office), franchise if brand desired | Remaining as an agent and paying splits when volume justifies independence |

## 7. Annual Cost Worksheet Template

Use this framework to calculate total annual brokerage cost at any production level:

```
ANNUAL BROKERAGE COST CALCULATION
==================================

A. Gross Commission Income (GCI):           $_______
   (Volume x Average Commission Rate)

B. SPLIT COST
   GCI x Split % to brokerage:              $_______
   OR Cap amount (if capped and cap reached): $_______
   Use the LESSER of the two:                $_______

C. MONTHLY FEES (annualized)
   Tech fee:        $___/month x 12 =        $_______
   Desk fee:        $___/month x 12 =        $_______
   E&O surcharge:   $___/month x 12 =        $_______
   Other monthly:   $___/month x 12 =        $_______
   TOTAL MONTHLY:                             $_______

D. PER-TRANSACTION FEES
   Fee per transaction:  $___
   x Transactions/year:  ___
   Total transaction fees:                    $_______

E. ANNUAL FEES
   Franchise fee:                             $_______
   Technology annual:                         $_______
   Other annual:                              $_______
   TOTAL ANNUAL:                              $_______

F. TOTAL ANNUAL BROKERAGE COST (B+C+D+E):   $_______

G. AGENT TAKE-HOME AFTER BROKERAGE (A-F):   $_______

H. EFFECTIVE SPLIT (G/A x 100):              _______%

==================================
VALUE RECEIVED (estimate replacement cost):

Training/coaching:                            $_______
Technology provided:                          $_______
Lead generation:                              $_______
Office space:                                 $_______
Administrative support:                       $_______
Marketing tools:                              $_______

Compliance infrastructure:                    $_______
TOTAL VALUE RECEIVED:                         $_______

==================================
NET COST OF BROKERAGE (F minus Value):       $_______
```

If Net Cost of Brokerage (total cost minus value received) exceeds $15,000-$20,000 at your production level, investigate alternatives. The higher your production, the more this number matters -- at $250K GCI, a $20K net cost difference represents 8% of gross income.
