# Vendor Partner Manager

An agent's vendor network is a direct extension of their service quality. The lender who fumbles a pre-approval, the inspector who misses a defect, the photographer who delivers dark photos three days late -- these failures land on the agent's reputation, not the vendor's. Yet most agents build their vendor list by accident: whoever the last agent in the office recommended, whoever handed out a business card at an association meeting, whoever answered the phone. This skill builds intentional vendor networks -- curated by category, evaluated on performance, compliant with RESPA, and managed as two-way business relationships that generate referrals, not just provide services. It serves solo agents who need a reliable bench of partners, team leaders who must standardize vendor quality across multiple agents, and broker/owners who manage preferred vendor programs for an entire office.

## Core Principles

1. **Your vendors are your brand.** Every vendor you recommend reflects on you. When a client's lender goes dark for three days before closing, the client does not blame the lender -- they blame the agent who recommended them. Curate ruthlessly. A vendor who delivers excellent work 90% of the time but catastrophically fails 10% of the time is not a good vendor. They are a liability you have not experienced yet.
2. **RESPA is not optional, and ignorance is not a defense.** The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits kickbacks and unearned referral fees between settlement service providers. You cannot receive compensation for sending clients to a specific lender or title company. You cannot accept gifts, trips, or payments disguised as "marketing fees" in exchange for referrals. Violations carry penalties up to $10,000 per occurrence and one year imprisonment. Every vendor relationship must pass this test: would this arrangement look the same if there were no referrals involved?
3. **Always present options, never a single name.** Providing clients with two to three vetted options per vendor category protects the agent legally, demonstrates objectivity, and respects client autonomy. Recommending only one vendor -- especially a settlement service provider -- creates the appearance of a kickback arrangement even when none exists. Options are both good practice and good protection.

### How to Respond to Vendor & Partner Management Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Building a Preferred Vendor List

Includes: how to find good vendors, who should be on my vendor list, vendor categories, building a vendor network from scratch, which vendors do I need, starting vendor relationships.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the user's experience level and current network. A new agent starting from zero has different needs than a team leader standardizing an existing list.
2. Walk through the essential vendor categories in priority order:
   - **Tier 1 (transaction-critical, interact directly with clients):** Mortgage lenders, title/escrow companies, home inspectors, real estate attorneys (required in some states, recommended in all complex transactions).
   - **Tier 2 (listing-critical, affect marketing and presentation):** Photographers/videographers, stagers, cleaning services.
   - **Tier 3 (service-enhancing, improve client experience):** Contractors/handymen, moving companies, home warranty providers, insurance agents.
   - **Tier 4 (specialized, as-needed):** Surveyors, appraisers (note: agents cannot select the appraiser for lender-ordered appraisals post-HVCC/Dodd-Frank), environmental testers (radon, mold, lead), roofers, plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians.
3. For each category, recommend maintaining two to three vetted options. Explain why: client choice, RESPA optics, coverage when one vendor is unavailable, and competitive pricing pressure.
4. Provide sourcing strategies: attend local association events, ask top-producing agents in the office, request referrals from existing trusted vendors (good vendors know other good vendors), interview candidates with the evaluation criteria from Category B.
5. Emphasize that the vendor list is a living document. Review quarterly: remove underperformers, add new options, update contact information and pricing.

#### Category B: Evaluating Vendor Performance

Includes: vendor scorecards, how to evaluate vendors, vendor metrics, when to drop a vendor, tracking vendor quality, client feedback on vendors, vendor accountability.

**Workflow:**
1. Present the vendor evaluation framework with six criteria, each scored 1-5:
   - **Quality of work:** Does the output meet professional standards? Is the inspection thorough, the photography sharp, the staging on-trend, the loan closing on time?
   - **Communication:** Does the vendor respond within a reasonable timeframe? Do they proactively update the agent and client? Can you reach them when problems arise?
   - **Timeliness:** Do they meet deadlines consistently? Is the inspection report delivered within 24 hours? Are photos back in 48 hours? Is the lender hitting closing timelines?
   - **Pricing:** Is their pricing competitive for the market? Are there hidden fees? Do they offer volume pricing for repeat business?
   - **Availability:** Can they accommodate urgent requests? Do they have capacity during peak season? How far out must you book?
   - **Client experience:** What feedback do your clients give? Would clients recommend this vendor independently? Are they professional, courteous, and presentable?
2. Recommend collecting feedback systematically: send a brief survey to clients after closing that asks about vendor experiences, or simply ask during the post-closing call.
3. Provide a red-flag checklist for immediate vendor removal:
   - Missed a contractual deadline that jeopardized a transaction
   - Received a formal complaint from a client
   - Failed to carry required licensing or insurance
   - Made misrepresentations about qualifications or pricing
   - Created a RESPA compliance concern
   - Repeatedly unreachable during business hours
4. Discuss the "one more chance" trap: agents tolerate underperforming vendors because switching feels inconvenient. The cost of one failed transaction -- lost commission, damaged reputation, potential E&O claim -- far exceeds the cost of finding a replacement vendor.
5. Cross-reference `transaction-coordinator` for how vendor performance affects closing timelines and transaction outcomes.

#### Category C: RESPA Compliance in Vendor Relationships

Includes: RESPA rules, can I receive referral fees, affiliated business arrangements, marketing agreements, vendor gifts, co-marketing, paying for leads from vendors, lender-paid marketing, title company marketing programs, is this legal.

**Workflow:**
1. State the core RESPA rule clearly: Section 8 of RESPA prohibits giving or receiving a "thing of value" for the referral of settlement service business. Settlement services include mortgage lending, title insurance, escrow, appraisals, and other services related to a real estate settlement.
2. Explain what is prohibited:
   - Receiving cash, gift cards, or payments in exchange for referring clients to a lender or title company
   - Accepting paid vacations, event tickets, or lavish gifts tied to referral volume
   - "Marketing agreements" where compensation is disproportionate to actual marketing services rendered
   - Sham arrangements where the agent provides no real service but receives a fee
   - Fee-splitting with settlement providers where no actual service is performed
3. Explain what is permitted:
   - Genuine co-marketing where both parties contribute and benefit proportionally (shared event costs, co-branded materials with actual distribution)
   - Nominal gifts of reasonable value (industry guidance typically under $25, though RESPA does not set a specific dollar limit -- use judgment)
   - Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBA) with proper disclosure: if the agent has an ownership interest in a title company or mortgage company, they may refer to it IF they provide the AfBA disclosure form, inform the client they are not required to use the affiliated provider, and do not condition the transaction on using the affiliate
   - Educational events hosted by vendors (lunch-and-learns, CE courses) where the primary purpose is education, not referral solicitation
   - Payments for actual services rendered at fair market value (e.g., paying a vendor for work they actually performed)
4. Provide the "newspaper test": if this arrangement were described on the front page of the local paper, would it look like a legitimate business relationship or a kickback scheme? If the answer is uncomfortable, restructure or abandon the arrangement.
5. Recommend documenting all vendor arrangements in writing, especially co-marketing agreements. Written agreements should specify services rendered, compensation amounts, and confirm that compensation is for services actually performed -- not referral volume.
6. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for broader RESPA guidance and other regulatory considerations.

#### Category D: Managing Referral Partner Relationships

Includes: lender as referral source, title rep relationships, vendor referrals to agents, building reciprocal referral relationships, co-marketing with vendors, vendor appreciation, maintaining partner relationships, nurturing vendor relationships.

**Workflow:**
1. Clarify the distinction between a vendor (provides services to your clients) and a referral partner (sends you business). The best vendor relationships serve both functions, but only when the referral dynamic develops organically from a strong service relationship -- not from a quid pro quo arrangement.
2. Identify the highest-value referral partner categories:
   - **Mortgage lenders:** The single highest-volume referral source outside an agent's SOI. Active loan officers interact with dozens of pre-approved buyers monthly. Build relationships with 2-3 top-producing LOs who share your client service standards.
   - **Title/escrow officers:** Interact with both sides of every transaction. Strong title reps know which agents are professional and refer accordingly.
   - **Real estate attorneys:** In attorney-close states, they are involved in every deal. In non-attorney states, they handle complex situations (estates, divorces, commercial) and refer the real estate side.
   - **Financial advisors and CPAs:** Clients planning major financial moves (retirement, inheritance, relocation) consult their financial advisor first.
   - **Insurance agents:** Interact with every homeowner and can identify people considering selling or buying.
3. Provide the relationship development framework:
   - **Initiate with a referral, not a request.** Send the vendor business first. Refer a client to the lender before asking for buyer referrals. Reciprocity follows generosity.
   - **Schedule regular touchpoints.** Monthly coffee or lunch meetings with top 3-5 partners. Quarterly check-ins with secondary partners. Do not let relationships go dormant.
   - **Co-create value.** Joint first-time buyer seminars, co-hosted neighborhood events, shared social media content, co-authored market reports. Activities that serve both parties' clients and build both brands.
   - **Track and acknowledge.** Know how many referrals each partner sends and sends back. Thank every referral within 24 hours -- a call, not just a text. Update them on outcomes. Close the loop.
4. Address the RESPA boundary: the referral relationship must be organic, not transactional. You can appreciate vendors who refer to you with reasonable gestures (a thank-you note, a modest holiday gift). You cannot create compensation structures tied to referral volume. Cross-reference `referral-systems` for broader referral partner strategy and SOI integration.
5. Recommend keeping referral partner relationships separate from vendor evaluations. A vendor who refers you three clients per year but delivers mediocre work is still a mediocre vendor. Do not let referral volume cloud quality assessment.

#### Category E: Vendor Coordination During Transactions

Includes: managing vendors during a deal, coordinating inspections, scheduling photographers, getting vendors to communicate, vendor delays, vendor dropped the ball, holding vendors accountable during a transaction.

**Workflow:**
1. Establish the agent's role as the quarterback of the transaction team. Every vendor must understand the timeline, the key dates, and who their points of contact are. Proactive coordination prevents most vendor-related delays.
2. Provide the transaction vendor coordination checklist:
   - At contract acceptance: confirm lender has received the contract and begun processing; schedule home inspection; confirm title order has been placed; notify any other required vendors (survey, septic, well, environmental tests).
   - At listing: schedule photography/videography within 48 hours of preparation completion; confirm stager timeline if applicable; coordinate cleaning service before photos and showings.
   - Throughout: provide vendors with key deadlines in writing; follow up at 50% and 75% of the deadline window; do not wait until the deadline has passed to check status.
3. Address vendor failures mid-transaction:
   - If a vendor is non-responsive: escalate immediately. Call their office, email their manager, and have a backup vendor ready to step in.
   - If a vendor misses a deadline: document the failure, communicate the impact to all parties, and implement the backup plan. Deal with accountability after the transaction closes.
   - If a vendor delivers substandard work: address it directly and immediately. Request a redo or correction before it impacts the client. A photographer who delivers poor photos gets one chance to reshoot before you switch.
4. Emphasize communication: copy your client on vendor scheduling confirmations so they know what is happening and when. Provide vendors with client contact information only when appropriate and with client consent.
5. Cross-reference `transaction-coordinator` for the complete timeline management framework that governs vendor coordination.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Vendor Category Deep Dive

**Mortgage Lenders**
The most consequential vendor in any transaction. A strong lender partner can pre-approve buyers quickly, communicate proactively, and close on time. A weak lender kills deals. Evaluate lenders on: pre-approval turnaround (should be same-day or next-day), communication frequency (weekly updates minimum during processing), on-time closing rate (ask for their percentage), loan program breadth (conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, jumbo, renovation), and local processing (local underwriting typically outperforms centralized operations). Maintain relationships with 2-3 lenders covering different niches: one strong conventional/jumbo lender, one strong FHA/VA/first-time buyer lender, and one credit union or portfolio lender for unusual situations. Cross-reference `mortgage-financing-guide` for loan product knowledge.

**Title/Escrow Companies**
Varies significantly by state -- some states use title companies, some use escrow companies, some use attorneys. Evaluate on: search accuracy, communication during processing, closing preparation thoroughness, fee transparency, and issue resolution speed. In states where the agent can direct title, this is both a service decision and a relationship decision. In states where the buyer selects title, recommend options but respect their choice.

**Home Inspectors**
The inspection can make or break a deal. Evaluate on: thoroughness (how long does a typical inspection take -- anything under 2 hours for a standard home is a red flag), report quality (clear photos, plain-language explanations, organized by system), turnaround time (report within 24 hours of inspection), communication style (does the inspector explain findings to the buyer or just hand over a document?), and professionalism (appearance, punctuality, client interaction). Maintain at least 2-3 options so you are not seen as steering. Cross-reference `estimate-analyzer` for how to interpret inspection findings and draft repair requests.

**Photographers/Videographers**
Listing photography is the single most important marketing investment. Properties with professional photos sell 32% faster and for up to 3-11% more. Evaluate on: image quality (consistent lighting, proper staging angles, color accuracy), turnaround time (48 hours maximum), drone/aerial capability, video and virtual tour capability, editing quality, and pricing structure (per-shoot vs. package). Book photographers early -- top photographers in busy markets are booked 1-2 weeks out. Cross-reference `listing-launch-engine` for how photography integrates into the full listing marketing plan.

**Stagers**
Professional staging returns $8-$12 for every $1 spent on average. Evaluate on: design quality relative to the property's price point and target buyer, inventory (do they have enough furniture and accessories?), turnaround time, pricing (hourly consultation vs. full staging packages), and flexibility (can they accommodate schedule changes?). For vacant homes, full staging is almost always worth the investment. For occupied homes, a consultation with the homeowner is often sufficient.

**Contractors/Handymen**
The most difficult vendor category to manage because quality varies wildly and demand consistently outstrips supply. Build a tiered list: licensed general contractors for major work (kitchen, bath, additions), reliable handymen for minor pre-listing repairs (paint, fixtures, landscaping), and specialized tradespeople for specific needs (roofers, plumbers, electricians, HVAC). Always verify licensing and insurance. Never guarantee a contractor's work or timeline to a client.

### RESPA Essentials

Section 8(a) of RESPA prohibits giving or accepting any "thing of value" for the referral of settlement service business. Section 8(b) prohibits fee-splitting or unearned fees -- no one may receive compensation for services not actually performed.

**Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBA):** If an agent, team, or brokerage has an ownership interest in a settlement service provider (title company, mortgage company), they may refer clients to that entity IF: (1) the AfBA disclosure is provided at or before the time of referral, (2) the client is informed they are not required to use the affiliated provider, and (3) the referring party receives only a return on their ownership interest, not a referral fee.

**Safe harbors under RESPA:** Payments for goods or facilities actually furnished at fair market value. Payments for services actually performed at fair market value. Employer-employee compensation. Normal promotional and educational activities that are not conditioned on referrals.

### Vendor Network Economics

A well-managed vendor network generates value in four ways:
1. **Client satisfaction:** Smooth transactions where vendors perform well generate positive reviews, referrals, and repeat business.
2. **Time savings:** Reliable vendors reduce the agent's coordination burden. An inspector who delivers reports on time, a lender who closes without drama, and a photographer who needs no hand-holding free the agent to focus on revenue-producing activities.
3. **Referral income:** Lenders, title reps, financial advisors, and attorneys who experience consistently professional transactions from an agent become referral sources.
4. **Competitive differentiation:** The agent who can coordinate an entire team of vetted professionals -- lender, inspector, stager, photographer, contractor, moving company -- delivers a concierge-level experience that justifies their commission and differentiates them from discount competitors.

### Industry Standards & References
- **RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607):** The federal statute governing referral fees and kickbacks among settlement service providers. Enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
- **CFPB Compliance Bulletins:** Periodic guidance from the CFPB on RESPA enforcement priorities, marketing service agreements, and affiliated business arrangements.
- **NAR Code of Ethics, Article 6:** "REALTORS shall not recommend or suggest to a client or a customer the use of services of another organization or business entity in which they have a direct interest without disclosing such interest at the time of the recommendation or suggestion."
- **State licensing boards:** Many states have additional rules governing vendor relationships, disclosures, and referral arrangements that go beyond federal RESPA requirements.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Practical and direct. Focus on building a lean vendor team with 2-3 options per category. Acknowledge that building vendor relationships takes time. Provide specific steps they can take this week. Do not overwhelm with enterprise-level vendor management systems -- a spreadsheet with contact info, evaluation notes, and referral tracking is a perfectly good starting point.

**To team leaders:** Operational and systematizing. The problem at team scale is consistency -- different agents recommending different vendors with different quality levels under the team brand. Focus on building a standardized preferred vendor list, creating evaluation criteria all team members follow, collecting feedback centrally, and establishing clear policies for vendor recommendations.

**To broker/owners:** Strategic and compliance-focused. Brokerages face the highest RESPA risk because vendor relationships often operate at the brokerage level. Focus on compliant preferred vendor programs, AfBA disclosure requirements, liability management, and the competitive advantage of a curated vendor ecosystem. Address the tension between vendor relationships that generate revenue (AfBAs) and the compliance exposure they create.

**To new agents:** Encouraging and foundational. New agents typically have no vendor relationships and feel uncomfortable recommending services they have not personally used. Encourage them to leverage their brokerage's existing vendor list initially, attend vendor-hosted events to build relationships, and gradually develop their own list as they gain transaction experience. Emphasize that every vendor interaction is an opportunity to evaluate quality.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Building a Vendor Network from Scratch
**User says:** "I just got my license and I don't know any vendors. Who do I need on my list and how do I find them?"
**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge that every new agent starts here. This is not a weakness -- it is an opportunity to build a network intentionally rather than inheriting someone else's mediocre contacts.
2. Prioritize the build order: start with Tier 1 vendors (lender, title, inspector, attorney if in an attorney-close state) because these are required for your first transaction. Tier 2 (photographer, stager) can wait until your first listing.
3. Provide sourcing strategies:
   - Ask your broker or mentor for their current recommended vendors
   - Attend local REALTOR association luncheons and affiliate member events
   - Ask each good vendor you find to recommend one vendor in a different category
   - Interview at least 3 candidates per category before selecting your initial list
4. Provide interview questions for initial vendor vetting: How long have you been serving this market? What is your typical turnaround time? How do you handle urgent requests? Can you provide references from other agents? What is your fee structure? How do you prefer to communicate?
5. Remind them to always present 2-3 options to clients per the RESPA best practice.

### Scenario 2: RESPA Compliance Question
**User says:** "A title company wants to pay me a monthly fee to be on my preferred vendor list. Is this RESPA compliant?"
**Actions:**
1. Flag this as a RESPA red flag. A title company paying an agent a fee to be on a preferred vendor list is almost certainly a prohibited referral fee under Section 8(a) unless there is a legitimate, documented service being provided in exchange.
2. Explain the test: Is the payment for actual services rendered at fair market value, or is it compensation for steering clients? If the agent's "service" is simply recommending the title company to clients, that is a referral -- not a service -- and the payment is prohibited.
3. Distinguish from legitimate arrangements: if the title company is paying for actual advertising services (e.g., the agent distributes the title company's brochures, hosts joint educational events, provides genuine marketing value), and the compensation is commensurate with the value of those specific services at fair market value, it may be permissible. But the burden of proof is on the parties to document the services and demonstrate fair market value.
4. Recommend consulting with their broker's compliance officer and potentially a real estate attorney before entering any such arrangement.
5. Provide the "newspaper test" as a practical gut check.
6. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for broader RESPA guidance.

### Scenario 3: Vendor Underperformance
**User says:** "My go-to lender has blown two closings in the last month. But he also sends me a lot of referrals. What do I do?"
**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge the tension directly: this is one of the hardest vendor management decisions, and many agents get it wrong by prioritizing referral volume over client experience.
2. Separate the two roles: evaluate the lender as a vendor (service provider to your clients) independently from the lender as a referral source (business relationship). A vendor who damages your client experience is eroding the very reputation that makes you referable.
3. Quantify the damage: two blown closings means delayed moves, expired rate locks, potential contract breaches, stressed clients, and likely zero referrals from those clients. Compare the referral value received against the referral value lost from unhappy clients.
4. Recommend a direct conversation with the lender: specify the failures, communicate your expectations (clear timelines, proactive communication, no more surprises), and set a defined probation period. If the pattern continues, transition the vendor role to a backup lender.
5. Address the referral concern: if the lender is a genuine referral source, the relationship does not have to end entirely. You can maintain the professional relationship and referral exchange while routing your clients to a more reliable lending partner. Be honest with the lender about why.
6. Reinforce the core principle: your clients' experience is your brand. No referral stream is worth a pattern of failed transactions.

### Scenario 4: Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure
**User says:** "My brokerage owns a title company. How do I handle recommending it to my clients?"
**Actions:**
1. Explain the Affiliated Business Arrangement (AfBA) rules: when a referring party has an ownership interest in a settlement service provider, they may refer clients to that entity -- but only with proper compliance.
2. Walk through the three AfBA requirements:
   - **Disclosure:** Provide the AfBA disclosure form to the client at or before the time of referral. The disclosure must identify the nature of the affiliation and the estimated charges.
   - **No required use:** Inform the client clearly that they are not required to use the affiliated title company and that other options exist. Present alternatives.
   - **Only return on ownership:** The referring party (brokerage or agent) may only receive returns on their ownership interest (dividends, distributions), not referral-based compensation. You cannot receive a per-file bonus tied to volume.
3. Provide practical guidance: have the AfBA disclosure form ready in your transaction packet. Present it early, present it matter-of-factly, and genuinely offer alternatives. Most clients will choose the convenient option, but the choice must be real.
4. Warn about the optics: even fully compliant AfBAs face scrutiny from consumer advocates and regulators. Ensure documentation is impeccable. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for additional AfBA considerations.

### Scenario 5: Standardizing Vendor Lists for a Team
**User says:** "I run a team of 8 agents and everyone recommends different vendors. Some are great, some are terrible. How do I fix this?"
**Actions:**
1. Frame this as a brand consistency issue: every vendor recommendation carries the team's name. One agent's bad vendor recommendation damages the entire team's reputation.
2. Build a team preferred vendor list:
   - Solicit nominations from all team members for each vendor category
   - Evaluate each nominated vendor against the six-criteria scorecard (quality, communication, timeliness, pricing, availability, client experience)
   - Select 2-3 approved vendors per category through team discussion
   - Document the list with contact info, specialties, pricing, and availability notes
   - Distribute to all team members and update quarterly
3. Set the policy: team members should recommend vendors from the approved list. Exceptions require team leader approval. This is not about control -- it is about quality assurance.
4. Implement feedback collection: after each closing, the TC or closing coordinator asks the client about vendor experiences. Aggregate feedback quarterly and review the list.
5. Hold a quarterly vendor review meeting: which vendors performed well, which had issues, which need to be replaced, and which new vendors should be considered.
6. Address the RESPA angle: ensure the team's preferred vendor program does not create the appearance of exclusive referral arrangements. Always present options to clients, never mandate a single vendor.

## Important Caveats

- **RESPA compliance varies in interpretation.** While the statute is federal, enforcement actions and CFPB guidance evolve. Marketing service agreements that were once common have faced increasing scrutiny. When in doubt, consult a real estate attorney or your brokerage's compliance officer before entering any compensation arrangement with a settlement service provider.
- **State-specific vendor regulations.** Some states have additional laws governing vendor referrals, required disclosures, and prohibited arrangements beyond federal RESPA. For example, some states require specific language in vendor recommendation disclosures. Always verify with your state's real estate commission.
- **Appraisal independence.** Under the Dodd-Frank Act and appraiser independence requirements, agents cannot select the appraiser for lender-ordered appraisals. You can order your own independent appraisal for pricing purposes, but the lender's appraisal is managed through an appraisal management company (AMC). Do not attempt to influence the lender's appraiser selection or the appraisal outcome.
- **Contractor liability.** When recommending contractors, clearly communicate that you are providing a referral -- not a guarantee of their work. You are not responsible for a contractor's workmanship, pricing, or timelines. Consider adding a disclaimer to your vendor list: "These are professionals I have worked with or who have been recommended by trusted colleagues. I do not guarantee their work. Please conduct your own due diligence."
- **This skill does not replace legal counsel.** RESPA compliance questions involving specific compensation structures, affiliated business arrangements, or marketing agreements should be reviewed by a real estate attorney. This skill provides general guidance on common scenarios, not legal advice for specific arrangements.
- **Insurance verification matters.** Always confirm that vendors -- especially contractors, inspectors, and any vendor entering a client's property -- carry appropriate licensing and insurance (general liability at minimum, E&O for inspectors and appraisers). If an uninsured vendor causes damage or injury at a property, the agent who recommended them may face liability exposure.
