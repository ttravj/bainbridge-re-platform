## 3. Transaction Management Tool Comparison

| Platform | Monthly Cost | E-Signature | Compliance Tools | Broker Dashboard | Task Automation | Mobile App |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Dotloop** | Free (basic) / $31.99 (premium) / brokerage pricing | Yes (built-in) | Basic | Yes (premium) | Basic templates | Good |
| **SkySlope** | $30-50/agent (brokerage) | Yes (DigiSign) | Strong (audit trail) | Yes (strong) | Checklist-based | Adequate |
| **ListedKit** | $20-40/month | Via integration | Basic | No | Good (templates) | Good |
| **Brokermint** | $100+/month (brokerage) | Via integration | Strong | Yes (full back office) | Commission tracking | Adequate |
| **Dotloop + FUB** | Combined pricing | Yes | Basic | Via FUB | Combined automation | Both apps |

### When to Use Each

- **Dotloop:** Best free option. Agents at brokerages that do not provide transaction management. Good e-signatures. Owned by Zillow Group, so strong Zillow integration.
- **SkySlope:** Best for compliance-focused brokerages. Strong audit trails for regulatory requirements. Requires brokerage-level commitment.
- **ListedKit:** Best for agents wanting modern task management with clean UX. Good for solo agents and small teams who outgrow spreadsheets.
- **Brokermint:** Best for brokerage back office operations. Commission tracking, disbursement, and agent management. Not agent-facing -- this is a brokerage operations tool.

## 4. E-Signature Platform Comparison

| Platform | Cost | Standalone | CRM Integration | Mobile | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Dotloop** | Free-$31.99/mo | Yes | Moderate | Good | Full transaction room + e-sign |
| **DocuSign** | $10-$65/mo | Yes | Strong (many CRMs) | Excellent | Industry standard. Most widely recognized by clients. |
| **SkySlope DigiSign** | Included with SkySlope | No (SkySlope required) | SkySlope only | Adequate | Brokerage-level only |
| **Authentisign** | Included with some MLSs | Via MLS | Limited | Basic | Free through some MLS boards |
| **Dotloop (via brokerage)** | Free (if brokerage provides) | Via brokerage account | Moderate | Good | Check if your brokerage includes it |

**Recommendation:** If your brokerage provides e-signature (Dotloop or SkySlope), use it -- do not pay separately. If you need standalone, DocuSign is the safest choice (highest client recognition and trust). If budget is tight and you want transaction management bundled, Dotloop Premium at $31.99/month is strong value.

## 5. IDX Website Platform Comparison

| Platform | Monthly Cost | CRM Included | SEO Quality | Lead Capture | Design Quality | Best For |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **BoldTrail (kvCORE)** | Included in CRM pricing | Yes | Good | Forced registration | Functional | All-in-one users |
| **Lofty** | Included in CRM pricing | Yes | Good | Smart registration | Modern, clean | Tech-forward agents |
| **Sierra Interactive** | $400-500+/mo | Yes (basic) | Excellent | Forced registration | Excellent | SEO-focused agents |
| **Real Geeks** | $299-599/mo | Yes | Good | Good | Good | Facebook ad agents |
| **AgentFire** | $149-$349/mo | No (integrates with CRMs) | Excellent | Customizable | Premium | Brand-focused agents |
| **Placester** | $99-$199/mo | No (basic tools) | Moderate | Basic | Good templates | Budget IDX |
| **Ylopo** | $295-$500+/mo | No (pairs with CRMs) | Good | Dynamic remarketing | Good | Agents running heavy paid ads |

**Key Consideration:** If you choose a CRM with built-in IDX (BoldTrail, Lofty, Sierra, Real Geeks), do not pay for a separate IDX website. If you choose a CRM without IDX (Follow Up Boss, LionDesk, Wise Agent), you will need a standalone IDX provider or a non-IDX website.

## 6. Power Dialer & Communication Tools

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Type | CRM Integration | Features | Best For |
|------|-------------|------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Mojo Dialer** | $99-$149/mo | Multi-line power dialer | Basic CSV export | Triple-line dialing, neighborhood search | FSBO/expired prospecting |
| **REDX** | $59-$199/mo | Lead data + dialer | Basic | Expired/FSBO/GeoLeads data + Vortex dialer | Prospecting agents |
| **Vulcan7** | $247-$349/mo | Lead data + dialer | Basic | Expired/FSBO data, circle prospecting | Heavy prospecting teams |
| **PhoneBurner** | $149/mo/user | Power dialer | Moderate (Zapier) | Leave pre-recorded voicemail, auto-emails | High-volume outbound |
| **FUB Built-in** | Included with FUB | Single-line | Native | Click-to-call, recording, call logging | FUB users |
| **BombBomb** | $33-$49/mo | Video email/text | Many CRMs | Video messages in email, tracking | Relationship-focused agents |
| **Loom** | Free-$15/mo | Video messaging | Via link | Screen recording, quick videos | Market updates, walkthroughs |

**When you need a dialer:** If you make 20+ outbound calls daily (FSBO, expired, circle prospecting, follow-up), a power dialer pays for itself. If you make 5-10 calls per day, your CRM's built-in calling or your phone is sufficient.

## 7. Tech Stack Recommendations by Business Model

### New Agent (Year 1-2, <10 transactions, Budget: $50-150/month)

| Tool | Recommendation | Monthly Cost | Why |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| CRM | LionDesk Starter or Wise Agent | $25-$32 | Affordable, learnable, adequate features for building the habit |
| E-Signature | Dotloop Free or brokerage-provided | $0 | Use free options until volume justifies premium |
| Website | Brokerage-provided or free social presence | $0 | Do not spend money on an IDX site until you have leads to drive to it |
| Email | Gmail (professional domain) or brokerage email | $0-$6 | Professional email is non-negotiable; a personal @gmail address undercuts credibility |
| Social Media | Canva Free + manual posting | $0 | Learn content creation before paying for scheduling tools |
| **Total** | | **$25-$38/month** | |

**Priority:** Build the daily CRM habit. Log every contact, every conversation, every lead. The tool does not matter -- the habit does.

### Solo Producer (10-30 transactions, Budget: $150-400/month)

| Tool | Recommendation | Monthly Cost | Why |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| CRM | Follow Up Boss Grow or LionDesk Pro | $49-$58 | Better automation, reporting, and integrations as volume grows |
| E-Signature | Dotloop Premium or DocuSign | $10-$32 | Transaction volume justifies dedicated e-sign |
| Transaction Mgmt | ListedKit or Dotloop Premium | $20-$32 | Deadline tracking becomes critical at 2+ closings/month |
| IDX Website (optional) | Placester or AgentFire (if running online ads) | $0-$149 | Only if online lead gen is a primary strategy |
| Email Marketing | Mailchimp Free or CRM built-in | $0-$13 | Monthly market updates to SOI |
| Social Media | Canva Pro + Later/Buffer | $13-$30 | Consistent content with scheduling saves time |
| **Total** | | **$92-$314/month** | |

**Priority:** Optimize the CRM -- set up pipeline stages, build 3 automations (new lead, post-closing, SOI drip). Track lead source ROI to know where to invest more. Cross-reference `lead-generation` for source analysis.

### Team (3-10 agents, Budget: $300-800/month for platform)

| Tool | Recommendation | Monthly Cost | Why |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| CRM | Follow Up Boss Pro or Lofty Team | $139-$250/user | Lead routing, agent accountability, pipeline visibility |
| E-Signature | Dotloop (team) or brokerage-provided | $0-$100 | Team-wide transaction management |
| Transaction Mgmt | SkySlope or Dotloop (team) | $30-$50/agent | Compliance and consistency across agents |
| IDX Website | Lofty (included) or Sierra + FUB | $0-$500 | Depends on online lead gen strategy |
| Dialer (optional) | FUB built-in or Mojo | $0-$149 | If team does outbound prospecting |
| **Total** | | **$400-$1,200/month** | |

**Priority:** Agent adoption and accountability. The CRM must be the single source of truth. Pull weekly activity reports. Route leads based on CRM engagement, not rotation -- agents who use the CRM get more leads. Cross-reference `team-management` for team structure.

### Brokerage (20+ agents, Budget: $30-60/agent/month)

| Tool | Recommendation | Monthly Cost | Why |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| CRM + IDX | BoldTrail (kvCORE) or Lofty Brokerage | $30-$50/agent | All-in-one with admin dashboard, compliance tools, company-wide reporting |
| Transaction Mgmt | SkySlope or Brokermint | $30-$50/agent | Audit trails, compliance, commission disbursement |
| Back Office | Brokermint (if not using SkySlope) | $100+/month | Commission tracking, agent management |
| E-Signature | Included with SkySlope or Dotloop brokerage | Included | Brokerage-wide standardization |
| **Total** | | **$60-$100/agent/month** | |

**Priority:** Data ownership and compliance. The brokerage must own the contact data and transaction records. Agent-facing features matter for adoption, but the brokerage dashboard is where you manage risk. Budget for a dedicated training period during rollout -- plan 4-6 weeks of onboarding with live training sessions, not just a webinar link.

## 8. CRM Selection Decision Framework

Answer these five questions to narrow your CRM choice:

### Question 1: What is your primary lead source?

| If... | Then consider... |
|-------|-----------------|
| SOI, referrals, and sphere | Wise Agent, LionDesk, or any simple CRM you will use daily |
| Zillow, Realtor.com, or portal leads | Follow Up Boss (best portal integrations) |
| Online ads (Google, Facebook) | Real Geeks, Lofty, or CINC (ad management built in) |
| FSBO, expired, cold prospecting | Follow Up Boss + Mojo/REDX (dialer integration) |
| Mixed sources | Follow Up Boss (most flexible routing) or Lofty |

### Question 2: Do you need an IDX website?

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| You run online ads driving to property search | Yes -- choose a CRM with IDX built in (BoldTrail, Lofty, Sierra, Real Geeks) or pair CRM + standalone IDX |
| Your leads come from SOI, referrals, and networking | Not essential -- a professional landing page or social media presence may suffice |
| Your brokerage provides a website | Use it (free) and invest your budget elsewhere |

### Question 3: What is your monthly tech budget?

| Budget | Best Options |
|--------|-------------|
| Under $50/month | LionDesk Starter ($25) or Wise Agent ($32) |
| $50-$150/month | LionDesk Pro ($49), Follow Up Boss Grow ($58), Realvolve ($49) |
| $150-$500/month | Follow Up Boss Pro ($139), Lofty ($399+), Real Geeks ($299) |
| $500+/month | Sierra ($400+), CINC ($600+), Lofty Team, FUB Platform |

### Question 4: How many people need access?

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Just you | Any platform works. Optimize for your workflow, not features you will never use. |
| 2-5 agents | Follow Up Boss (per-user, scales well), Lofty (team tier), Real Geeks Grow |
| 6-20 agents | Follow Up Boss Platform, Lofty Brokerage, BoldTrail |
| 20+ agents | BoldTrail Brokerage, Lofty Brokerage, CINC (high investment) |

### Question 5: What is your technical comfort level?

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| "I struggle with my phone" | Wise Agent (best support, simplest interface) |
| "I can figure things out" | LionDesk, Real Geeks, Follow Up Boss Grow |
| "I'm tech-savvy and want control" | Follow Up Boss Pro, Lofty, Sierra |
| "I want AI to do the work" | Lofty (strongest AI), Chime, or FUB + AI integrations |

## 9. Data Migration Checklist

Use this checklist when switching CRMs:

### Before You Switch

- [ ] Confirm the new CRM integrates with your MLS and primary lead sources
- [ ] Verify pricing for your specific needs (per-user costs, add-on features, API access tier)
- [ ] Request a demo with YOUR data scenario (not just the sales presentation)
- [ ] Ask about data export capabilities from the new platform (exit strategy)
- [ ] Confirm your brokerage allows the CRM you are choosing (some restrict to in-house tools)

### Export from Old CRM

- [ ] Export full contact database as CSV (all fields: name, email, phone, tags, source, notes, address, important dates)
- [ ] Export deal/transaction history if available
- [ ] Screenshot or document your current automation workflows and drip campaigns (these do not export)
- [ ] Screenshot your current pipeline stages and tag taxonomy
- [ ] Export any templates (email, text) you want to keep
- [ ] Save reporting data (lead source stats, conversion rates) -- this history will be lost
- [ ] Verify the export file is complete by spot-checking 10-20 records against the live CRM

### Prepare for Import

- [ ] Clean the exported CSV: remove duplicates, fix formatting, standardize tags
- [ ] Map old CRM fields to new CRM fields (field names differ between platforms)
- [ ] Create your tag taxonomy in the new CRM before importing
- [ ] Set up pipeline stages in the new CRM before importing deals
- [ ] Test import with 20-50 records first -- verify all fields mapped correctly
- [ ] Fix any mapping issues before full import

### After Import

- [ ] Spot-check 25+ records for data accuracy (names, emails, phones, tags, notes)
- [ ] Verify contact counts match between export file and new CRM
- [ ] Rebuild your top 3 automation workflows (new lead response, post-closing, SOI drip)
- [ ] Recreate email and text templates
- [ ] Connect lead sources (Zillow, website, etc.) to the new CRM
- [ ] Set up your daily CRM routine in the new platform
- [ ] Keep old CRM account active (read-only) for 90 days as reference for missed data
- [ ] Cancel old CRM subscription after 90-day verification period
