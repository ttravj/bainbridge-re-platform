### Buy-Side (Buyer Agent) Commission

| Price Range | Average Rate | Typical Range | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Under $200K | 2.65-2.80% | 2.5-3.0% | Higher rate offsets lower dollar amount |
| $200K-$350K | 2.50-2.60% | 2.25-3.0% | Largest transaction volume segment |
| $350K-$500K | 2.45-2.55% | 2.25-2.75% | Competitive middle market |
| $500K-$750K | 2.30-2.45% | 2.0-2.75% | Rate compression begins |
| $750K-$1M | 2.20-2.35% | 2.0-2.5% | Higher dollar amount offsets lower rate |
| $1M-$2M | 2.10-2.25% | 1.75-2.5% | Luxury threshold |
| $2M-$5M | 1.90-2.15% | 1.5-2.5% | Highly negotiated |
| $5M+ | 1.50-2.00% | 1.0-2.5% | Wide variation, often flat fee component |

**National average buy-side: ~2.42% (Q3 2025)**

### List-Side (Listing Agent) Commission

| Price Range | Average Rate | Typical Range | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Under $350K | 2.75-3.00% | 2.5-3.0% | Less disrupted by settlement |
| $350K-$750K | 2.50-2.75% | 2.25-3.0% | Standard market |
| $750K-$1.5M | 2.25-2.60% | 2.0-2.75% | Begins to compress |
| $1.5M+ | 2.00-2.50% | 1.5-2.5% | Luxury market, more negotiation |

**National average list-side: ~2.60% (Q3 2025)**

### Total Commission (Both Sides Combined)

| Market Type | Average Total | Typical Range |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Entry-level (<$300K) | 5.25-5.75% | 5.0-6.0% |

## 2. Commission Rate Trends (2019-2025)

### Average Buy-Side Commission Over Time

| Year | Average Buy-Side Rate | Key Context |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| 2019 | 2.51% | Pre-lawsuit baseline |
| 2020 | 2.49% | COVID market, low inventory |
| 2021 | 2.46% | Seller's market, slight compression |
| 2022 | 2.44% | Rate hikes begin, market shifts |
| 2023 | 2.39% | Sitzer-Burnett verdict (October) |
| Q1 2024 | 2.36% | Pre-settlement uncertainty |
| Q3 2024 | 2.36% | Settlement effective Aug 17 |
| Q1 2025 | 2.40% | Post-settlement stabilization |
| Q3 2025 | 2.42% | Slight rebound, market adjusting |

**Key Takeaway:** Rates did NOT collapse post-settlement. After a brief dip driven by uncertainty, rates have slightly increased as agents who remain in the business have strengthened their value propositions and consumers have accepted the new framework.

### Long-Term Trend Projection (Industry Consensus)

| Timeframe | Projected Buy-Side Range | Drivers |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|
| 2026-2027 | 2.30-2.50% | Continued adjustment, increased buyer-pays instances |
| 2028-2030 | 2.15-2.45% | Gradual compression, unbundled services grow |
| 2030-2035 | 2.00-2.40% | Technology displacement at low end, premium at high end |

Compression of 50-100 basis points over the next decade is the consensus estimate. The "race to zero" narrative is not supported by data or market dynamics.

## 3. Brokerage Model Comparison Economics

### Major Brokerage Models (2025)

| Brokerage / Model | Agent Split | Cap | Monthly Fees | Per-Transaction Fees | Other Costs | Revenue Share / Equity |
|-------------------|-----------|-----|-------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Traditional (Coldwell Banker, Anywhere)** | 60/40 to 70/30 | None (uncapped) | $0-$200 desk/office | $0-$500 | E&O ~$300-$600/yr | None |
| **Keller Williams** | 64/30/6 (6% franchise) | $18K-$25K (market-dependent) | $85/mo tech fee | $0-$250 | E&O ~$400/yr | Profit share (7-tier) |
| **eXp Realty** | 80/20 | $16,000 | $85/mo | $250/txn after cap ($75 pre-cap) | $40/qtr broker review | Revenue share (7-tier), equity ($400 vested/yr or $16K ICON) |
| **Real Broker** | 85/15 | $12,000 | $0 | $285/txn after cap | $750/yr E&O | Revenue share (5-tier), equity awards |
| **Compass** | 70/30 to 90/10 (negotiated) | None typically | $0 | Varies | E&O varies | Stock grants (pre-IPO ended), agent equity program |
| **RE/MAX** | 95/5 (after desk rent) | N/A | $1,500-$3,000 desk rent | $0-$250 | Dues, E&O | None |
| **Redfin (employed model)** | Salary + bonus | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Benefits, salary stability |
| **Flat-fee / 100% Models** | 100% | N/A | $300-$1,500/mo | $200-$500/txn | Varies | None typically |

### How to Read the Table

"Split" is the starting point, not the ending point. An agent's **effective split** -- what actually reaches their pocket -- requires calculating all fees, caps, and costs against their production volume. A 70/30 split with no fees can be better than an 85/15 split with high monthly and transaction fees at low production levels, and worse at high production levels.

## 4. Effective Split Calculations by Production Level

### Scenario: What Does the Agent Actually Keep? (Brokerage Portion Only)

Assumptions: Average commission rate of 2.5%, applied to annual closed volume. Numbers show brokerage costs only (before business expenses and taxes).

#### $3M Annual Volume (~$75,000 GCI)

| Model | Brokerage Take | Agent Keeps | Effective Split |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Traditional 70/30 | $22,500 | $52,500 | 70.0% |
| KW 64/30/6 | $22,500 + $4,500 + $1,020 = $28,020 | $46,980 | 62.6% |
| eXp 80/20 | $15,000 + $1,020 + $900 = $16,920 | $58,080 | 77.4% |
| Real 85/15 | $11,250 + $2,850 + $750 = $14,850 | $60,150 | 80.2% |
| RE/MAX 95/5 | $3,750 + $24,000 desk = $27,750 | $47,250 | 63.0% |

#### $6M Annual Volume (~$150,000 GCI)

| Model | Brokerage Take | Agent Keeps | Effective Split |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Traditional 70/30 | $45,000 | $105,000 | 70.0% |
| KW (capped at $22K) | $22,000 + $1,020 = $23,020 | $126,980 | 84.7% |
| eXp (capped at $16K) | $16,000 + $1,020 + $2,750 = $19,770 | $130,230 | 86.8% |
| Real (capped at $12K) | $12,000 + $5,700 + $750 = $18,450 | $131,550 | 87.7% |
| RE/MAX 95/5 | $7,500 + $24,000 desk = $31,500 | $118,500 | 79.0% |

#### $10M Annual Volume (~$250,000 GCI)

| Model | Brokerage Take | Agent Keeps | Effective Split |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Traditional 70/30 | $75,000 | $175,000 | 70.0% |
| KW (capped) | $22,000 + $1,020 = $23,020 | $226,980 | 90.8% |
| eXp (capped) | $16,000 + $1,020 + $5,250 = $22,270 | $227,730 | 91.1% |
| Real (capped) | $12,000 + $9,500 + $750 = $22,250 | $227,750 | 91.1% |
| RE/MAX 95/5 | $12,500 + $24,000 desk = $36,500 | $213,500 | 85.4% |

**Key Insight:** At low production ($3M), traditional and capped models are comparable. At high production ($10M+), capped and cloud models save $40K-$50K+ annually versus uncapped traditional splits. The breakeven point is typically around $4-6M in annual volume.

## 5. GCI-to-Net Income Benchmarks

### The Full Waterfall: From Gross Commission to Take-Home

Using a mid-market example: $400,000 sale, 2.5% commission = $10,000 gross commission.

| Step | Amount | Running Total |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Gross Commission | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| Brokerage split (70/30) | -$3,000 | $7,000 |
| Transaction fee | -$300 | $6,700 |
| E&O insurance allocation | -$50 | $6,650 |
| **= GCI After Split** | | **$6,650** |
| MLS dues allocation (per txn) | -$50 | $6,600 |
| Association dues allocation | -$40 | $6,560 |
| Marketing (allocated per txn) | -$250 | $6,310 |
| CRM/tech (allocated per txn) | -$75 | $6,235 |
| Auto/mileage (allocated per txn) | -$150 | $6,085 |
| Other business expenses (per txn) | -$100 | $5,985 |
| **= Net Business Income** | | **$5,985** |
| Self-employment tax (15.3%) | -$916 | $5,069 |
| Federal income tax (~22% marginal) | -$1,317 | $3,752 |
| State income tax (~5% avg) | -$299 | $3,453 |
| **= Actual Take-Home** | | **$3,453** |

**The agent keeps 34.5% of the gross commission on this transaction.**

### GCI-to-Net Ratios by Production Level

| Annual GCI | Typical Net Income % | Net Income $ | Key Factors |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
| $50,000 | 35-45% | $17,500-$22,500 | High expense ratio, lower tax bracket |
| $100,000 | 40-50% | $40,000-$50,000 | Expenses spread across more transactions |
| $150,000 | 42-52% | $63,000-$78,000 | Approaching cap on capped models |
| $200,000 | 45-55% | $90,000-$110,000 | Strong efficiency if expenses controlled |
| $300,000 | 45-55% | $135,000-$165,000 | Higher tax brackets offset scale benefits |
| $500,000+ | 45-55% | $225,000-$275,000 | Top bracket, but maximum brokerage efficiency |

**Critical Insight:** The GCI-to-net ratio does not improve dramatically with higher production because higher income pushes agents into higher tax brackets. The primary lever is controlling expenses and optimizing the brokerage split. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for entity structure strategies (S-Corp election) that can improve the ratio at higher income levels.

## 8. Regional Commission Variations

Commission rates vary significantly by region. These are general ranges and should not be cited as market-specific data.

| Region | Average Total Commission | Buy-Side Average | Notes |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Northeast (NY, NJ, CT, MA) | 4.5-5.5% | 2.2-2.5% | Attorney-state closings add cost; often lower rates |
| Southeast (FL, GA, NC, SC, TN) | 5.0-6.0% | 2.5-3.0% | Generally higher rates |
| Midwest (OH, MI, IL, IN, MN) | 5.0-6.0% | 2.5-3.0% | Stable, less compression |
| Southwest (TX, AZ, NM, NV) | 5.0-5.5% | 2.4-2.7% | Growing markets, moderate rates |
| Mountain West (CO, UT) | 5.0-5.5% | 2.3-2.6% | High-value markets compressing |
| Pacific Northwest (WA, OR) | 5.0-5.5% | 2.4-2.6% | Urban compression, rural holds |
| California | 4.5-5.5% | 2.0-2.5% | Highest price points, most compression |
| Hawaii | 5.0-6.0% | 2.5-3.0% | Unique market dynamics |

**Important:** These are directional ranges. Always research the specific local market. Never cite regional averages as applicable to a specific transaction or area -- that approach creates antitrust risk.
