## How to Use These Scripts

These scripts are frameworks, not word-for-word recitations. Adapt the language to your personality, market, and the specific client. The structure and key phrases are what matter -- they are designed to:

- Lead with value before discussing price
- Normalize the conversation (every agent charges a fee, every professional does)
- Address the real concern behind the stated objection
- Maintain compliance with antitrust and settlement requirements
- Never apologize for your fee

**Critical Rules for All Commission Conversations:**
- Never say "the standard rate" or "the going rate" -- say "my fee" or "our brokerage's fee"
- Always include: "My fees are fully negotiable -- they are not set by law"
- Never disparage another agent's fee or business model
- Never pressure a client to sign -- inform, then let them decide
- Practice these out loud before using them with clients

---

## 1. Initial Buyer Commission Conversation

**Context:** First buyer consultation. The agent has spent 15-20 minutes discussing the buyer's goals, timeline, and needs. Now transitioning to the business discussion.

### The Transition

> "Now that I understand what you're looking for and how I can help, let me walk you through how the business side works -- because the rules changed in 2024 and I want to make sure you understand how it all works before we move forward."

### Explaining the Fee

> "My fee for buyer representation is [X% / $X]. Here's what that covers: I represent YOUR interests exclusively throughout the entire process -- from finding properties and analyzing value, to negotiating the best price and terms, to managing the inspection, appraisal, and closing process. I protect you from overpaying, I catch problems before they cost you money, and I coordinate everything so you don't have to."

### Explaining Who Pays

> "Now, here's what most people don't realize: in the majority of transactions, the seller still contributes to the buyer agent's compensation. That's negotiated as part of the offer. So while my fee is [X%], in most cases it doesn't come out of your pocket -- it's part of the overall transaction. I'll always fight to get the seller to cover it. If a seller does not offer compensation, I'll let you know upfront so we can discuss options before you ever see the property."

### Closing the Business Discussion

> "I want to be transparent: my fees are fully negotiable. They're not set by law. But I charge what I charge because I deliver results -- [specific example: average negotiation savings, problems caught, client testimonial]. Does this make sense? Do you have any questions about how the compensation works?"

---

## 2. Buyer Objection: "Why Should I Pay You?"

**Context:** Buyer pushes back on the concept of agent compensation. Often comes from buyers who have been reading articles about the NAR settlement.

### The Response Framework

> "That's a fair question, and I'm glad you asked it. Let me show you what you actually get."

**Then walk through the value stack (pick 4-5 that resonate with this buyer):**

> "Here's what I do for every buyer I represent:
>
> **Market analysis and pricing:** I'll analyze every property before you see it so you know whether the asking price is justified. My clients don't overpay -- on average, I negotiate [X% / $X] below asking price in this market.
>
> **Access and information:** I have access to properties before they hit the public sites, I can get showing feedback from listing agents, and I know the history behind listings -- why they're selling, how motivated they are, and what the competition looks like.
>
> **Negotiation:** I negotiate for a living. The average buyer who negotiates on their own leaves $5,000-$15,000 on the table compared to a skilled agent.
>
> **Due diligence:** I coordinate inspections, review reports, identify red flags, and draft repair requests. One missed foundation issue or HVAC problem can cost more than my entire fee.
>
> **Transaction management:** There are over 100 steps between an accepted offer and closing. One missed deadline can cost you your earnest money or the entire deal.
>
> My fee is [X%]. On a [$X] home, that's [$X]. If I save you $10,000 in negotiation and catch one $5,000 problem during inspection, I've already paid for myself twice over."

### If They're Still Resistant

> "You absolutely have the right to buy a home without representation. Some buyers do. But in my experience, unrepresented buyers pay more, miss problems, and have more deals fall apart. My job is to make sure that doesn't happen to you. Whether you choose to work with me or another agent, I'd strongly recommend having representation."

---

## 3. Buyer Objection: "Can I Just Use the Listing Agent?"

**Context:** Buyer wants to work directly with the listing agent, assuming they'll get a "better deal" or save on commission.

### The Response

> "You can, and here's what you should know before you make that decision.
>
> The listing agent represents the seller. Their job -- their legal obligation -- is to get the seller the highest price and best terms. When you work with them directly, you're working with the other side's advocate.
>
> It's like going to court and asking the opposing attorney to represent you too. They might be a great attorney, but their loyalty is to their client.
>
> Here's what happens in practice: the listing agent may offer a slight price reduction because they're keeping both sides of the commission. But studies consistently show that dual-agency transactions do NOT result in lower prices for buyers -- because the listing agent's incentive is still to maximize the seller's price. You might save 1-2% on commission but overpay 3-5% on the purchase price.
>
> With me representing you exclusively, my only job is to protect your interests. I will negotiate against the listing agent on your behalf. I will point out problems with the property that the listing agent is not going to volunteer. And in many cases, I save buyers far more in negotiation than my fee costs."

### Handling "But I'll Save Money"

> "Let me show you the math. On a $400,000 home:
>
> **Without buyer agent:** You might save $10,000 in commission -- maybe. But without someone negotiating exclusively for you, market data shows unrepresented buyers pay 3-5% more on average. That's $12,000-$20,000.
>
> **With me:** My fee is $10,000. But if I negotiate $15,000 off the price and catch $8,000 in inspection issues, you're ahead $13,000 net.
>
> The question isn't whether you pay for representation. It's whether you pay more by NOT having it."

---

## 4. Buyer Objection: "I Can Do This Myself"

**Context:** Buyer believes they can handle the purchase without an agent, often citing online listings and information availability.

### The Response

> "You absolutely can. The information is out there, the contracts are available, and you can coordinate all the parties yourself. Here's what I'd want you to think about:
>
> Finding a home is maybe 10% of what I do. The other 90% is what happens after you find one. Are you comfortable:
>
> - Analyzing whether the asking price is fair based on recent sales, adjustments for condition and features, and current market absorption rates?
> - Drafting an offer with the right contingencies, timelines, and terms to protect you without killing the deal?
> - Negotiating directly with a professional listing agent whose job is to get the seller top dollar?
> - Interpreting an inspection report and knowing which findings are dealbreakers, which are negotiation points, and which are cosmetic?
> - Coordinating with the lender, title company, appraiser, inspector, and potentially the seller's attorney to hit every deadline?
> - Reviewing the closing disclosure to catch errors before you sign?
>
> If you can do all of that, you may not need me. But most people hire professionals for high-stakes financial transactions -- accountants for taxes, attorneys for legal matters. Your home is probably the largest purchase of your life.
>
> And remember: in most transactions, the seller still covers the buyer agent compensation. So my services often cost you nothing out of pocket."

---

## 5. Buyer Agency Agreement Resistance

**Context:** Buyer does not want to sign the buyer agency agreement before touring homes. This is the most common post-settlement objection.

### The Response

> "I completely understand. This is new for everyone. Let me explain what changed and why this agreement actually protects you.
>
> In August 2024, the rules changed across the entire real estate industry. Now, every buyer must have a written agreement with their agent before touring any property -- including open houses. This isn't my policy; it's how the industry works now. Any agent you work with will require this.
>
> Here's the good news: this agreement actually works in your favor. It means:
>
> 1. **You know exactly what you're paying before you start.** No surprises at the closing table.
> 2. **My duties to you are clearly defined.** I have a legal obligation to represent your best interests.
> 3. **The terms are specific.** It covers a defined time period and specifies exactly what services I provide.
>
> And here's what it doesn't do: it doesn't lock you into anything unreasonable. We can start with [30 days / 3 properties / a trial period] so you can see how I work before committing to a longer term. My fees are fully negotiable, and I'm happy to walk you through every line."

### If They Want a Shorter Term

> "Absolutely. Let's start with [30 days / a specific set of properties you want to see]. That gives us time to work together without a long commitment. If we're a good fit, we extend. If not, no hard feelings. The important thing is that the agreement is in place before we tour -- that keeps both of us in compliance and makes sure your interests are protected."

### If They Flat-Out Refuse

> "I respect that. Unfortunately, I'm not able to show you properties without the agreement in place -- it's a compliance requirement, not a preference. But I want to help. Here are your options:
>
> 1. We sign a short-term agreement -- even limited to a single property -- so I can show you what I do.
> 2. You attend open houses on your own (some MLSs may still require a signed agreement even at open houses -- check local rules).
> 3. You work with another agent -- but they'll need the same agreement.
>
> I'd love to earn your business. If you'd like to start with a single-property agreement just to test the waters, I'm happy to do that."

---

## 6. Buyer Objection: "Your Fee Is Too High"

**Context:** Buyer agrees to work with an agent but pushes back on the specific fee amount.

### The Response

> "I appreciate your honesty. Let me share why I charge what I charge, and then let's see if we can find a structure that works for both of us.
>
> My fee of [X%] reflects the full-service representation I provide. That includes [list 3-4 key services]. On a [$X] home, that's [$X amount].
>
> Here's the context: the average buyer agent in [market] charges between [X% and Y%]. My fee is [at/slightly above/below] that range because [specific reason: experience, track record, services included].
>
> Now, here's what I can do:
>
> 1. **I can explain the value you're getting** -- and if I'm doing my job, I'll save you more than my fee in negotiation and problem prevention.
> 2. **I can offer a different service level** -- if you want to handle some parts yourself (like finding properties), I can offer a reduced fee for a more limited scope of service.
> 3. **We can negotiate** -- my fees are fully negotiable. If there's a number that works better for you, let's talk about it.
>
> What I won't do is cut corners on representation. If I reduce my fee, I need to reduce my time and service accordingly. What matters most to you in an agent?"

## 7. Seller Conversation: Offering Buyer Agent Compensation

**Context:** Listing appointment or listing discussion where the agent needs to advise the seller on whether and how much to offer buyer agent compensation.

### Framing the Decision

> "One of the most important strategic decisions we'll make together is how to handle buyer agent compensation. Let me walk you through the options and the economics, because this directly impacts how many buyers see your home and what you net at closing.
>
> Since 2024, buyer agent compensation is no longer advertised on the MLS. But sellers can still offer it -- and here's why most do:
>
> **The market reality:** About 85-90% of buyers work with an agent. Most of those buyers are stretching to afford their down payment and closing costs. If they also have to pay their agent 2-3% on top of that, many simply won't consider your home. They'll focus on properties where the seller is offering compensation.
>
> **The math:** Let's say your home is listed at $400,000.
>
> - **Option A: Offer 2.5% buyer agent compensation.** That's $10,000. Your home is shown by virtually every buyer agent in the area. Maximum exposure, competitive offers, potentially multiple offers.
>
> - **Option B: Offer nothing.** You save $10,000 in compensation. But your buyer pool shrinks significantly. Fewer showings, longer DOM, and likely a lower sale price. If the home sells for even 2% less ($392,000), you've actually netted $2,000 LESS while sitting on the market longer.
>
> The properties that sell fastest and at the highest prices are the ones where buyer agents know their clients are taken care of. Offering competitive compensation is not a gift to the buyer's agent -- it's a marketing strategy that attracts more buyers and better offers."

### Recommending a Specific Strategy

> "Based on our market right now, I'd recommend offering [X%] in buyer agent compensation. Here's why:
>
> - That's [at/above/below] what comparable listings in your area are offering.
> - It will keep your property competitive with the [X] other homes in your price range.
> - We'll communicate this to buyer agents through [listing agent outreach, broker-to-broker channels, showing instructions -- NOT the MLS].
>
> Of course, this is your decision. My fees and any offer of buyer agent compensation are fully negotiable and not set by law. I want to give you the information to make the best decision for your situation."

## 8. Seller Objection: "Why Should I Pay the Buyer's Agent?"

**Context:** Seller pushes back on offering buyer agent compensation, citing the NAR settlement or general principle.

### The Response

> "I hear you, and you're right that you're under no obligation to offer buyer agent compensation. Let me share what I'm seeing in the market so you can make an informed decision.
>
> The sellers in our market who are choosing not to offer buyer compensation are experiencing:
>
> - **Fewer showings** -- buyer agents focus their clients on properties where compensation is offered, because most buyers can't afford to add 2-3% on top of their purchase costs.
> - **Longer days on market** -- [X] days longer on average in our area compared to homes offering compensation.
> - **Lower offers when they do come** -- buyers who come without agents still negotiate, and they often use the fact that the seller isn't paying buyer compensation as leverage to negotiate a lower price.
>
> So while you save $[X] by not offering compensation, the data suggests you may net less overall because of the reduced competition for your home.
>
> Here's my recommendation: let's offer a competitive buyer agent compensation of [X%], market the property aggressively, and position it for the strongest possible sale price. If multiple offers come in, we're negotiating from a position of strength. The $[X] you invest in buyer agent compensation comes back as a higher sale price and a faster close."

## 9. New Agent Explaining Their Fee

**Context:** A newer agent who may lack a long track record needs to justify their fee confidently.

### The Framework

> "I want to be upfront with you: I'm [relatively new to real estate / building my business]. Here's why that actually works in your favor, and here's what I bring to the table.
>
> **My brokerage:** I'm backed by [brokerage name], which has [X years in this market, X agents, support infrastructure]. I have direct access to [experienced broker, mentor, team leader] who reviews every transaction I handle. You're not just getting me -- you're getting our entire organization.
>
> **My commitment:** I have [fewer clients / more availability] than a high-volume agent. That means you get MORE of my time and attention, not less. When you call, I answer. When you want to see a property, I'm available. When you have a question at 9pm, I'm responding.
>
> **My training:** I've completed [specific training, certifications, continuing education]. I study this market every day. I know the inventory, the neighborhoods, and the data.
>
> **My fee:** My fee is [X%], which is [competitive with / consistent with] experienced agents in our market. My fees are fully negotiable and not set by law. I charge this because the work I do -- the analysis, negotiation, coordination, and protection -- is the same whether I've closed 5 deals or 500. And I have something a lot of busy agents don't: the time to give your transaction the attention it deserves."

---

## 10. Luxury / High-Net-Worth Fee Discussion

**Context:** Working with a luxury buyer or seller ($1M+) who may expect a lower rate or more sophisticated fee structure.

### The Approach

> "At this price point, the economics and the service level are both different. Let me walk you through how I approach luxury transactions.
>
> My fee for a property in the [price] range is [X% / $X flat]. Here's what that reflects:
>
> **Elevated marketing and exposure:** At this price point, off-market networking, targeted outreach to qualified buyers, and premium marketing materials are essential. Your property won't be marketed like a $400,000 listing.
>
> **Specialized negotiation:** The stakes are higher, the buyers are more sophisticated, and the deal structures are more complex. [1031 exchanges, trust purchases, entity structures, multi-property considerations] all factor in.
>
> **Discretion and white-glove service:** My clients at this level expect responsiveness, privacy, and seamless coordination across multiple parties -- attorneys, CPAs, wealth managers, contractors, and sometimes international buyers.
>
> **The value math:** On a [$X] home, my fee is [$X]. My average negotiation result at this price point is [X% above/below asking for sellers/buyers], which means I typically [earn/save] [$X] more than my fee.
>
> I'm happy to discuss a fee structure that makes sense for your situation. Some of my luxury clients prefer a flat fee, some prefer a percentage, and some prefer a hybrid with a base fee and a performance component. What matters is that you get the level of service this transaction requires."

---

## 11. Investor Buyer Fee Discussion

**Context:** Working with a real estate investor who buys multiple properties and may expect a volume discount or different fee structure.

### The Approach

> "Working with investors is a bit different from working with traditional homebuyers, and I'm happy to structure my fee in a way that reflects our ongoing relationship.
>
> For a single transaction, my fee is [X%]. But since you're looking at multiple properties, here's what I can offer:
>
> **Volume-based structure:** For [X+] transactions per year, I can offer a reduced rate of [Y%] per transaction. The volume makes up the difference.
>
> **Flat fee per deal:** For investment properties in the [$X-$Y] range, I can work on a flat fee of [$X] per acquisition. This keeps your acquisition costs predictable.
>
> **Consulting retainer:** If you want ongoing market analysis, deal evaluation, and off-market property sourcing without committing to a per-transaction fee, we can discuss a monthly retainer that covers [X] hours of work plus a reduced transaction fee when you close.
>
> Here's what I provide that goes beyond the standard buyer agent role:
>
> - **Investment analysis:** Cap rate, cash-on-cash return, rent comps, and expense projections before you make an offer.
> - **Off-market access:** I actively source off-market and pre-market opportunities in your target areas.
> - **Speed:** Investors need to move fast. I understand that and structure my workflow around it.
> - **Property management referrals:** I have vetted contacts for everything from property managers to contractors.
>
> What deal volume are you targeting this year? Let me put together a fee structure that makes sense for both of us."

---

## 12. Commission Reduction Request

**Context:** A client (buyer or seller) asks you to reduce your commission during the transaction or at the listing appointment.

### The Response Framework

> "I appreciate you asking, and I want to have an honest conversation about this.
>
> My fee of [X%] reflects the full scope of what I do for you. Let me share what that includes: [briefly list 3-4 key services].
>
> I'm always willing to discuss my fee -- it's fully negotiable. But I want to be transparent about what a reduced fee means in practice:
>
> **Option 1: Same service, lower fee.** I can reduce my fee to [Y%]. I'll still provide full service, and I'll make it work. [Use this only if you're genuinely willing and the client relationship justifies it.]
>
> **Option 2: Adjusted service, adjusted fee.** At [Y%], I can offer [reduced scope -- for example: you find properties, I handle negotiation and closing]. This keeps the fee aligned with the workload.
>
> **Option 3: Performance-based adjustment.** I'll charge my full [X%], but if I achieve [specific result -- e.g., sale price above $X, closing within X days], the fee stays as-is. If I don't hit that target, I'll reduce to [Y%]. That way my fee is tied to my performance.
>
> What I can't do is reduce my fee AND maintain the same level of service, marketing, and attention. Something has to give. What matters most to you?"

### The "Everyone Else Charges Less" Response

> "I respect that you're doing your research. You'll find agents who charge less -- and agents who charge more. Here's what I'd encourage you to look at beyond the rate:
>
> 1. **What's included?** Some agents charge less because they do less. Ask them specifically what they provide.
> 2. **What's their track record?** Average sale-to-list ratio, days on market, client results.
> 3. **What happens when things go wrong?** A lower-fee agent with less experience or fewer resources can cost you far more in a difficult negotiation, inspection dispute, or closing complication than the fee difference.
>
> I charge [X%] because I deliver [specific result]. If at the end of our transaction you don't feel you got that value, I want to hear about it. But I'm confident in what I provide."

---

## 13. Explaining the Post-Settlement Changes to Clients

**Context:** Buyer or seller who has heard about the NAR settlement and is confused or concerned about what it means for their transaction.

### For Buyers

> "You may have heard about changes in the real estate industry. Here's what actually changed and what it means for you.
>
> In August 2024, some rules were updated about how real estate agent compensation works. Here are the key points:
>
> 1. **You now sign a written agreement with your agent before we tour homes together.** This is actually a good thing -- it means you know upfront exactly what my services cost and what you're getting. No surprises.
>
> 2. **My fee is clearly stated in that agreement.** It's [X%], and it's fully negotiable. It's not set by law or by any industry standard.
>
> 3. **Who pays my fee?** In most cases, the seller still contributes to the buyer agent's compensation as part of the transaction. I negotiate for that in every offer. If a seller doesn't offer it, I'll let you know before we tour the property so we can discuss how to handle it.
>
> 4. **Your cost may be $0 out of pocket.** In the majority of my transactions, the seller covers my fee. When they don't, we'll explore options -- including rolling it into your financing in some cases.
>
> The bottom line: you get better transparency and clearer representation. Nothing about the quality of service or protection you receive has changed."

### For Sellers

> "If you've been reading about the changes in real estate, here's what you need to know as a seller.
>
> The main change is that buyer agent compensation is no longer advertised on the MLS. But sellers can still choose to offer it -- and here's why most still do.
>
> Think of buyer agent compensation as a marketing cost, not a gift to the other agent. When you offer competitive compensation, buyer agents know they'll be fairly compensated and are more likely to show your home. More showings means more competition, which means a better price for you.
>
> Here's what hasn't changed: my listing fee is [X%], and that's between us. What you choose to offer the buyer's agent is a separate decision. I'll advise you on what's competitive in our market, but ultimately it's your call.
>
> My fees -- and any offer of buyer agent compensation -- are fully negotiable and not set by law."
