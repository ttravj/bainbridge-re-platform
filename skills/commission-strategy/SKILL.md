# Commission Strategy

The most time-sensitive skill in the platform. Helps agents navigate the post-NAR settlement commission landscape -- fee negotiation, buyer agency agreements, compensation structures, brokerage economics, and value articulation. This is existential: agents who cannot have the commission conversation confidently will lose business to those who can. Every agent, from first-year licensees to 30-year veterans, must rebuild their compensation approach from the ground up.

## Core Principles

1. **Commissions are fully negotiable and always have been.** Every document, conversation, and presentation must reinforce this. Never imply a "standard" or "going" rate -- that language creates antitrust exposure. Always say "my fee" or "our brokerage's fee," never "the commission."
2. **Value precedes price.** Never lead with your fee. Establish what you do, what it prevents, and what it produces before any number is discussed. The consultation-first model is now both best practice and regulatory requirement.
3. **Post-settlement compliance is non-negotiable.** Buyer agency agreements before touring, objectively ascertainable compensation, no open-ended terms, and the required negotiability disclosure on every agreement. Cutting corners here is a compliance violation with real consequences.

### How to Respond to Commission & Compensation Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Post-Settlement Rules & Requirements

Includes: what changed, new rules, buyer agency agreement requirements, MLS changes, settlement impact, compliance questions.

**Workflow:**
1. Confirm the specific rule or requirement with accurate post-August 17, 2024 information.
2. Explain the practical impact on the agent's daily workflow.
3. Provide the compliance steps they must follow -- buyer agreement timing, required language, compensation specificity.
4. Flag state-specific variations if relevant (many states updated forms and added requirements beyond the federal settlement).
5. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for deeper regulatory guidance.

#### Category B: What to Charge / Fee Structure Design

Includes: how much to charge, setting commission rate, tiered services, flat fee vs. percentage, hourly consulting, fee structure.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask about their market (price point, geography), production level, and brokerage model if not provided.
2. Provide current benchmark data from `references/commission-benchmarks.md` -- never a single "recommended" rate (antitrust).
3. Walk through the GCI-to-net calculation so they understand what each rate actually means to their income. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for deep financial analysis.
4. Present fee structure options: percentage, flat fee, tiered service, hourly -- with pros/cons for their situation.
5. Recommend they build a value proposition that justifies their fee. Cross-reference `value-proposition-builder`.

#### Category C: Commission Conversations & Objection Handling

Includes: how to discuss fees with buyers, seller conversations about offering buyer compensation, objections like "why should I pay you," scripts, role-play requests.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the specific scenario (buyer consultation, seller listing appointment, mid-transaction pushback, specific objection).
2. Provide the relevant script framework from `references/commission-scripts.md`.
3. Coach on delivery: tone, timing, body language cues, and the consultation-first structure.
4. Address the specific objection with data and reframing techniques.
5. Remind them: never disparage competitors' fees, never suggest a "standard" rate, never pressure -- inform and let the client decide.

#### Category D: Brokerage Economics & Split Analysis

Includes: is my split fair, brokerage comparison, cap analysis, revenue share, when to switch brokerages, understanding splits.

**Workflow:**
1. Gather their current brokerage model details (split, cap, fees, monthly costs, revenue share).
2. Calculate their effective split (what actually reaches their pocket after all brokerage costs).
3. Compare against benchmark models from `references/commission-benchmarks.md`.
4. Factor in non-monetary value (training, leads, technology, brand, mentorship) -- splits alone do not tell the story.
5. Cross-reference `brokerage-evaluator` for full brokerage comparison if they are considering switching.

#### Category E: Antitrust & Legal Compliance in Commission Discussions

Includes: can I discuss rates with other agents, price-fixing concerns, MLS rules, required disclosures, DOJ oversight.

**Workflow:**
1. Provide clear antitrust guardrails: never discuss, agree on, or coordinate rates with competing agents or brokerages.
2. Explain the required negotiability disclosure language.
3. Clarify what IS and IS NOT permitted in commission discussions.
4. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for comprehensive regulatory guidance.
5. Always recommend consulting their broker and/or legal counsel for specific situations.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Post-NAR Settlement Rules (Effective August 17, 2024)

The Sitzer-Burnett verdict ($1.78B, later settled by NAR for $418M) led to practice changes binding on all NAR-member MLSs:

- **No buyer agent compensation on the MLS.** Offers of compensation can no longer be communicated through MLS fields or data feeds.
- **Written buyer agency agreement required before touring.** This includes open houses. The agreement must be in place before any property showing.
- **Compensation must be objectively ascertainable.** A specific dollar amount, percentage of sale price, or hourly rate. "Whatever the seller offers" is not compliant.
- **No open-ended agreements.** The agreement must have a defined duration and scope.
- **Required negotiability disclosure.** Every agreement must conspicuously state: "Broker fees and commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable."
- **Sellers can still offer buyer agent compensation.** They simply cannot do so through the MLS. Methods include: listing agent communicates to buyer agents directly, seller concessions at closing, or direct negotiation.

### Current Commission Benchmarks

See `references/commission-benchmarks.md` for full data. Key numbers:

- Average buy-side commission: ~2.42% (Q3 2025)
- Average total commission: ~5.0-5.5%
- Homes under $500K: ~2.52% buy-side
- Homes $500K-$1M: ~2.35% buy-side
- Luxury ($1M+): ~2.21% buy-side
- Rates have actually increased slightly post-settlement, not decreased

### GCI-to-Net Income Framework

Most agents do not understand their real economics. The path from gross commission to net income:

1. **Gross Commission** (sale price x commission rate)
2. **Minus brokerage split** (varies by model: 30% traditional, 20% cloud, or capped)
3. **Minus brokerage fees** (transaction fees, tech fees, E&O, desk fees)
4. **= GCI after split**
5. **Minus business expenses** (marketing, MLS dues, association dues, auto, phone, CRM, lead gen)
6. **Minus self-employment tax** (15.3% on net profit)
7. **Minus federal/state income tax** (marginal rate on remaining)
8. **= Actual take-home income**

Typical agent keeps 40-55% of GCI as net income. Many keep less.

### Fee Structure Options

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Percentage of sale** | Traditional 2-3% | Most transactions, easiest to explain |
| **Flat fee** | Fixed dollar amount | Lower price points, high-volume agents |
| **Tiered service** | Multiple packages at different prices | Agents wanting to serve varied clients |
| **Hourly consulting** | Per-hour fee for specific services | Investor clients, experienced buyers |
| **Hybrid** | Base fee + success bonus | Emerging model, complex to explain |

### Antitrust Guardrails

**Never:**
- Discuss your commission rate with competing agents at other brokerages
- Agree with other agents or brokerages on rates, fees, or splits
- Suggest there is a "standard," "typical," or "going" rate in your market
- Refuse to show properties based on the compensation offered (or not offered)
- Coordinate boycotts of low-commission listings or discount brokerages

**Always:**
- Set your fee independently based on your value, costs, and business model
- Say "my fee" or "our brokerage's fee" -- never "the commission"
- Include the negotiability disclosure on every agreement
- Be willing to explain and justify your fee with specifics
- Document the value you provide

### Industry Standards & References

- **NAR Settlement Terms (2024):** Binding practice changes on all NAR-member MLSs. Full text available at nar.realtor.
- **DOJ Antitrust Division:** Ongoing oversight of real estate commission practices. The DOJ did not sign off on the NAR settlement and retains the right to pursue further action.
- **State Real Estate Commissions:** Govern licensing, disclosure requirements, and form updates. Many states updated buyer agency agreement forms post-settlement -- always use the current state-approved form.
- **RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act):** Prohibits kickbacks and referral fees between settlement service providers. Commission sharing between cooperating brokers is permitted; paying referral fees to unlicensed parties is not.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Direct and practical. They need scripts they can use tomorrow, math that shows their real income, and confidence to have the conversation. Do not sugarcoat -- if their fee is too low for their market and expenses, say so.

**To team leaders:** Strategic. Focus on team-wide commission structures, training agents on fee conversations, and modeling team economics. They need to set policy and ensure consistency.

**To broker/owners:** Compliance-forward and economic. They care about brokerage-level risk (antitrust, settlement compliance) and the financial modeling of different split structures. Speak in terms of agent retention, recruiting competitiveness, and regulatory exposure.

**To new agents:** Encouraging but honest. They are terrified of the commission conversation. Give them a framework they can practice, explain the math so they are not shocked by their first commission check after splits and taxes, and normalize that every agent had to learn this.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: New Agent Setting Their Buyer Fee for the First Time

**User says:** "I just got my license. What should I charge buyers? I don't want to scare them off."

**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge the anxiety is universal -- every new agent struggles with this.
2. Provide market benchmark data (2.4-2.5% average buy-side) without recommending a specific rate. Explain the range and what drives it.
3. Walk through the GCI-to-net calculation at different rates so they see what each percentage actually means to their income after splits, fees, taxes, and expenses.
4. Coach them on the consultation-first approach: meet with the buyer, demonstrate value, THEN discuss compensation. Never lead an initial conversation with price.
5. Provide the buyer consultation script framework from `references/commission-scripts.md`.
6. Cross-reference `value-proposition-builder` for creating their buyer presentation.
7. Remind them: their fee must be specified in the buyer agency agreement before any showings.

### Scenario 2: Buyer Refuses to Sign the Buyer Agency Agreement

**User says:** "My buyer says they won't sign the buyer agency agreement. They say they just want to see a few houses first."

**Actions:**
1. Clarify that the written agreement is now required before touring -- this is not optional and not the agent's policy; it is an industry-wide requirement.
2. Provide language for explaining this to the buyer: "I understand this feels new. The rules changed in August 2024 for the entire industry. Every agent you work with will need this agreement before showing you homes. Here's what it covers and what it protects for you..."
3. Reframe the agreement as buyer protection: it defines the agent's duties, sets expectations, and ensures the buyer knows exactly what they are paying and what they are getting.
4. Address the underlying concern -- the buyer is likely worried about being locked in. Explain that the agreement has a defined duration and scope, and many agents offer a short initial term (e.g., 30-60 days or limited to specific properties) to build trust.
5. Provide the objection-handling script from `references/commission-scripts.md` (Category: Buyer Agreement Resistance).
6. If the buyer truly will not sign, the agent cannot show them properties. Period. This is the new reality.

### Scenario 3: Seller Asks Whether They Should Offer Buyer Agent Compensation

**User says:** "My seller doesn't want to pay the buyer's agent. They say the buyer should pay their own agent. How do I handle this?"

**Actions:**
1. Validate the seller's perspective -- they have every right to decide. This is their money.
2. Present the strategic case for offering compensation: it expands the buyer pool, reduces days on market, and typically results in a higher net sale price. Not offering it may reduce showings.
3. Provide market-specific data: in most markets, 85-95% of buyers are still represented by agents, and most cannot afford to add 2-3% on top of their down payment and closing costs.
4. Explain the mechanics: the compensation can be structured as a seller concession, built into the listing price, or offered directly off-MLS. It does not have to appear on the MLS.
5. Present the net-sheet math: compare the net proceeds with and without offering buyer compensation, factoring in likely sale price differences and DOM impact.
6. Provide the seller conversation script from `references/commission-scripts.md`.
7. Emphasize: ultimately this is the seller's decision. The agent's role is to inform, not pressure.

### Scenario 4: Experienced Agent Evaluating Their Brokerage Split

**User says:** "I'm on a 70/30 split and I closed $8M last year. Am I leaving money on the table?"

**Actions:**
1. Calculate their current economics: at $8M in volume with a ~2.5% average commission, that is ~$200K GCI. A 70/30 split means ~$60K goes to the brokerage before any fees.
2. Model the same production on alternative structures: capped (KW ~$22K cap), cloud (eXp $16K cap at 80/20), high-split (Real 85/15, $12K cap). Include monthly fees, transaction fees, and other costs.
3. Present the comparison showing take-home difference -- at $8M volume, a capped or cloud model likely saves $20-40K+ annually versus an uncapped 70/30.
4. Factor in the non-monetary side: what does the current brokerage provide in leads, training, support, brand, and technology? Sometimes a lower split is worth it; sometimes it is not.
5. Cross-reference `brokerage-evaluator` for a comprehensive brokerage comparison.
6. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for a full financial analysis including taxes and expenses.

### Scenario 5: Agent Worried About Commission Compression

**User says:** "Everyone says commissions are going to zero. Should I start cutting my rate now to stay competitive?"

**Actions:**
1. Counter the narrative with data: post-settlement average buy-side rates have actually ticked UP slightly (2.36% to 2.42%). The collapse has not happened and likely will not happen suddenly.
2. Explain the dynamics: sellers still need buyer agents to bring qualified buyers. Buyers still need representation. The value proposition has not changed -- only the mechanics of how compensation is communicated and agreed upon.
3. Acknowledge the long-term trend: rates may compress 50-100 basis points over the next 5-10 years. This is gradual, not a cliff.
4. Recommend investing in value articulation rather than rate reduction. Agents who can clearly explain and prove their value will maintain rates. Agents competing on price alone will race to the bottom.
5. Provide the value-over-price framework: for every $1,000 in commission an agent earns, they should be able to point to $3,000+ in client value (negotiation savings, problems prevented, time saved).
6. Cross-reference `value-proposition-builder` for building their value case.

## Important Caveats

- **State-specific variations are significant.** Buyer agency agreement requirements, disclosure forms, and commission practices vary by state. Many states have enacted additional rules beyond the NAR settlement. Always verify with the applicable state real estate commission and use current state-approved forms.
- **This skill does not provide legal advice.** Commission practices intersect with antitrust law, contract law, and state regulatory requirements. For specific legal questions, agents should consult their broker and/or a real estate attorney.
- **This skill does not provide tax advice.** The GCI-to-net calculations are frameworks, not tax guidance. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for deeper analysis and always recommend a CPA for tax-specific decisions.
- **Market data is directional, not prescriptive.** Commission benchmarks reflect market averages. Agents set their own fees based on their value, costs, and business model. Never present benchmark data as a recommendation of what to charge.
- **Antitrust compliance requires constant vigilance.** Even casual conversations between agents about rates can create legal exposure. When in doubt, do not discuss your commission structure with agents at competing brokerages.
- **The settlement terms may evolve.** The DOJ did not sign off on the NAR settlement and has indicated it may pursue further changes. Monitor nar.realtor and state association updates for new developments.
