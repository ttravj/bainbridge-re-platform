# Lead Generation

The engine skill. Every real estate business rises or falls on its ability to generate a predictable pipeline of buyer and seller opportunities. This skill covers the entire lead generation ecosystem -- from SOI cultivation and geographic farming to paid digital advertising, FSBO/expired prospecting, open houses, and content marketing. It provides lead source evaluation frameworks, conversion benchmarks, budget allocation guidance, and compliance guardrails for every prospecting method. It serves solo agents building from scratch, top producers diversifying sources, team leaders scaling acquisition, and new agents who do not yet understand that lead generation is their actual job -- not showing houses.

## Core Principles

1. **Diversification is survival.** No agent should depend on a single lead source for more than 40% of their business. Zillow changes pricing, your SOI has a slow year, Facebook Ads costs spike -- if your income depends on one channel, you are one algorithm change away from a crisis. Build the three-legged stool: relational, proactive, and inbound.
2. **Consistency beats intensity.** The agent who prospects for 90 minutes every day for a year will outproduce the agent who grinds for 12-hour days in January and then stops. Lead generation is a compounding activity -- results lag effort by 3-6 months. The agents who quit in month two never see the pipeline they were building.
3. **Track ROI or waste money.** Every dollar spent on lead generation must be traceable to leads generated, appointments set, closings completed, and net income produced. An agent who cannot tell you their cost per closing from each source is making budget decisions blind. Gut feelings about "what's working" are not a strategy.

## Instructions

### How to Respond to Lead Generation Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Lead Source Strategy & Budget Allocation

Includes: where to spend marketing budget, which lead sources are best, how to diversify, marketing plan, lead source selection, budget recommendations.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask about their current production level (transactions/year), market (price point, geography), existing lead sources, and marketing budget if not provided.
2. Assess their current source mix against the three-legged stool framework: relational (SOI, past clients, referral partners), proactive (farming, FSBO/expired, door knocking, open houses), and inbound (paid ads, SEO, content, email nurture).
3. Identify gaps. Most agents are over-indexed on one leg. New agents often have no relational base yet. Experienced agents often neglect inbound. Team leaders often over-spend on paid leads while starving SOI investment.
4. Recommend source allocation based on their production level and goals. Provide conversion benchmarks for each recommended source so they can set realistic expectations.
5. Calculate expected ROI for recommended sources using benchmarks from the Key Domain Knowledge section. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for lead source ROI methodology.
6. Address compliance requirements for each recommended source (TCPA for calling/texting, CAN-SPAM for email, DNC for cold calling, fair housing for all advertising).

#### Category B: SOI & Database Management

Includes: sphere of influence, past client follow-up, database building, contact management, how often to reach out, CRM usage, database segmentation.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask about their current database size, CRM platform, and existing touch cadence if not provided.
2. Provide the SOI segmentation framework (A/B/C tiers by transaction likelihood -- see Key Domain Knowledge).
3. Recommend a multi-channel touch plan: the 33-36 touch system combining calls, emails, direct mail, social media, and events across the year.
4. Identify the highest-value database activities: past client outreach (annual home value updates, anniversary check-ins), life event monitoring (marriage, baby, job change, retirement), and referral ask cadence.
5. If they lack a CRM or database, this is the priority fix. No lead generation strategy works without a system of record. Cross-reference `crm-tech-advisor` for CRM selection and setup.
6. Cross-reference `referral-systems` for deeper referral partner and past client nurture strategies.

#### Category C: Online Leads & Speed-to-Lead

Includes: Zillow leads, Realtor.com, paid leads, Facebook ads, Google ads, online lead conversion, internet leads, lead follow-up, speed to lead, ISA.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask which paid lead platforms they are currently using, monthly spend, and their follow-up process (who responds, how fast, what happens after first contact).
2. Address speed-to-lead immediately: the single biggest factor in online lead conversion is response time. Under 5 minutes is the target. After 30 minutes, conversion drops 80%+. If they are responding in hours or days, no amount of lead spend will fix their conversion problem.
3. Provide the online lead nurture framework: immediate response (auto-text/email within 60 seconds), personal follow-up call within 5 minutes, structured nurture sequence over 6-18 months. 80% of online leads that will transact do so between 6 and 18 months -- agents who abandon follow-up after 2 weeks are throwing away their investment.
4. Calculate their current cost per closing from online sources and compare against benchmarks ($1,500-$5,000+ depending on market and source).
5. Recommend systems: auto-responder tools, power dialers, AI chatbots for initial qualification, and ISA (Inside Sales Agent) evaluation if volume justifies the hire.
6. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for evaluating whether their online lead spend is actually profitable after all costs.

#### Category D: Prospecting — Farming, FSBO, Expired, Door Knocking

Includes: geographic farming, how to farm a neighborhood, FSBO prospecting, expired listing calls, door knocking, circle prospecting, cold calling, direct mail.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify which prospecting method they are asking about and their experience level with it.
2. For geographic farming: provide the farm selection methodology (300-500+ homes, 5%+ annual turnover, manageable competition, alignment with price point). Explain the 12-18 month maturation period. Recommend the multi-channel approach: direct mail + door knocking + social media targeting + neighborhood events.
3. For FSBO/expired prospecting: provide scripts and frameworks, not just "call them." Cover the mindset (they need help, not a sales pitch), the value proposition (what you bring that they cannot do themselves), and the follow-up cadence (most convert on contact 5-12, not contact 1).
4. For door knocking / circle prospecting: provide the just-listed/just-sold framework, recommended scripts, timing guidance (Saturday mornings, weekday afternoons), and realistic expectation setting (20-30 doors = 1-3 meaningful conversations).
5. Address compliance: DNC registry check before cold calling (FSBO sellers are generally exempt for 3 months after their listing appears), state-specific solicitation rules, and brokerage advertising requirements on all marketing materials.
6. Calculate the time-adjusted ROI: prospecting methods are "free" in dollar cost but expensive in time. An agent spending 15 hours/week door knocking must value that time. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for effective hourly rate calculation.

#### Category E: Open Houses as Lead Generation

Includes: open house strategy, how to get leads from open houses, open house marketing, open house follow-up, mega open house.

**Workflow:**
1. Reframe the open house as a lead generation event, not just a service to the seller. The attendees who walk through are pre-qualified: they are physically out looking at homes.
2. Provide the complete open house lead gen system: pre-event promotion (social media, door knock 50 neighbors, email blast), day-of capture (sign-in system -- digital preferred, conversation starters, showing packet with buyer agency information), and post-event follow-up (call within 24 hours, add to database, nurture sequence).
3. Recommend the "mega open house" format for maximum lead capture: Friday twilight or Saturday 12-3, heavy promotion including boosted social posts and neighborhood invitations, food/beverage, and a drawing or market report giveaway.
4. Address the buyer agency agreement requirement: post-settlement rules require a written agreement before touring. At open houses, the hosting agent is typically representing the seller; buyers walking through do not need a buyer agency agreement with the hosting agent. However, if the hosting agent begins providing buyer representation services (recommending properties, discussing offer strategy), the agreement requirement may trigger. Know your state's interpretation.
5. Provide realistic benchmarks: 5-20 contacts per open house, 1-3% convert to clients within 6 months. Agents hosting 2-4 open houses per month can generate 15-50+ new contacts monthly.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### The Three-Legged Stool Framework

Every sustainable real estate business is built on three lead source categories. Agents who master all three create a pipeline that withstands market shifts, platform changes, and seasonal cycles.

**Leg 1: Relational/Referral (Foundation)**
SOI, past clients, referral partners. Highest conversion (12-25%), lowest cost ($200-$500 per closing). This is the foundation because these people already trust you. Every agent has a sphere -- most just fail to cultivate it systematically.

**Leg 2: Proactive/Outbound (Accelerator)**
Geographic farming, FSBO/expired prospecting, door knocking, circle prospecting, open houses. Moderate conversion (3-10%), moderate cost (primarily time). This is the accelerator because agents control the volume directly -- more activity = more leads. No waiting for the phone to ring.

**Leg 3: Inbound/Automated (Long-term Asset)**
Paid ads (Zillow, Google, Meta), SEO, content marketing, email nurture, social media. Lower conversion (1-3%), higher cost ($1,500-$5,000+ per closing). This is the long-term asset because once built, it generates leads with lower ongoing time investment. But it requires patience -- 6-18 months before ROI materializes.

### SOI Segmentation Framework

| Tier | Definition | Touch Frequency | Annual Touches |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **A — Active Pipeline** | Ready to transact within 6 months | Weekly | 50+ |
| **B — Core Sphere** | Past clients, close friends/family, referral partners, likely to refer or transact within 12-24 months | Bi-weekly to monthly | 24-36 |
| **C — Extended Network** | Acquaintances, old leads, social connections, unlikely to transact soon but worth maintaining | Monthly to quarterly | 12-18 |
| **D — Dormant** | No engagement in 12+ months, unqualified leads, low-probability contacts | Quarterly at most | 4-6 |

### Lead Source Benchmarks

| Source | Conversion Rate | Cost Per Lead | Cost Per Closing | Time to Convert | Time Investment |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SOI / Past clients | 12-25% | $5-$20 | $200-$500 | 1-6 months | Low (systematic touches) |
| Referral partners | 10-20% | $0-$25 | $300-$800 | 1-3 months | Moderate (relationship building) |
| Geographic farming | 1-3% annually | $2-$5 per home/month | $1,000-$3,000 | 12-18 months | Moderate (mail + door knock) |
| Open houses | 1-3% of attendees | $50-$200 per event | $500-$2,000 | 3-12 months | High (4-6 hours per event) |
| FSBO prospecting | 3-8% | $0-$50 | $200-$1,000 | 2-8 weeks | High (daily calling) |
| Expired prospecting | 3-10% | $0-$100 | $200-$1,500 | 1-4 weeks | High (daily calling) |
| Zillow Premier Agent | 1-3% | $20-$75 | $2,000-$5,000 | 6-18 months | Moderate (follow-up) |
| Google Ads | 2-5% | $15-$50 | $1,500-$4,000 | 3-12 months | Low (system-driven) |
| Meta/Facebook Ads | 0.5-2% | $5-$25 | $2,000-$6,000 | 6-18 months | Moderate (nurture required) |
| Content/SEO | 3-8% (inbound) | $0-$500/month | $500-$2,000 | 6-24 months | High (content creation) |

### Speed-to-Lead Requirements

This is the single most impactful change most agents can make to their online lead conversion:

- **Under 1 minute:** Auto-text or auto-email acknowledgment. Systems-driven -- no human required.
- **Under 5 minutes:** Personal phone call or text. This is where deals are won. Agents who call within 5 minutes are 100x more likely to connect than those who wait 30 minutes.
- **Under 1 hour:** If the first call went to voicemail, follow-up text plus email with value (property details, market report, neighborhood guide).
- **Day 1-7:** Structured follow-up cadence: call/text daily for 3 days, then every other day.
- **Day 8-90:** Weekly touch via email, text, or automated drip.
- **Day 91-365:** Bi-weekly to monthly nurture. This is where 80% of conversions happen -- and where most agents have already given up.

### Geographic Farming Methodology

**Farm Selection Criteria:**
1. **Size:** 300-500 homes for a solo agent, 500-1,000 for a team
2. **Turnover rate:** Minimum 5% annual turnover (homes sold / total homes)
3. **Competition:** No dominant agent with 20%+ market share already established
4. **Price point alignment:** Matches the agent's target price range
5. **Proximity:** Agent can physically door knock and attend neighborhood events
6. **Identity affinity:** Agent has a connection to the area (lives there, kids go to school there, expert in the neighborhood)

**Multi-Channel Farm Approach:**
- Monthly direct mail (just-listed/just-sold, market updates, home value reports)
- Quarterly door knocking (introduce yourself, deliver market reports, ask about plans)
- Social media geo-targeting (ads targeting the zip code / neighborhood)
- Neighborhood events (annual BBQ, school supply drive, holiday gathering)
- Digital farming (email drip to captured contacts in the farm area)

**Timeline Expectations:** Months 1-6: building awareness, minimal leads. Months 6-12: recognition growing, 2-5 listing leads. Months 12-18: established presence, regular listing appointments. Year 2+: the farm feeds itself with referrals and repeat.

### FSBO & Expired Prospecting Framework

**FSBO Approach:**
The seller chose to sell without an agent. Do not open by telling them they are wrong. Lead with value:
1. Introduce yourself as a neighborhood specialist, not a salesperson.
2. Offer a free CMA or market report -- no strings attached.
3. Ask about their experience so far: traffic, showings, offers. Listen.
4. Identify specific pain points (pricing questions, buyer qualification, contract concerns, legal exposure) and offer targeted help.
5. Position as a resource. Most FSBOs list with an agent within 3-6 weeks. Be the agent they already trust when that decision comes.

**Expired Listing Approach:**
The seller is frustrated. Their home did not sell. Do not blame the previous agent.
1. Acknowledge their frustration. "I know this isn't the outcome you expected."
2. Ask what they believe went wrong -- pricing, marketing, condition, agent effort.
3. Present your specific marketing plan for their home -- not a generic pitch.
4. Address the price conversation directly if the listing was overpriced.
5. Follow up consistently. Most expired sellers re-list within 30-60 days. Contact 5-12 times.

### Online Lead Platform Comparison

| Platform | Lead Type | Typical CPL | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Zillow Premier Agent** | Active buyers | $20-$75 | High intent, property-matched | Expensive, shared leads, inconsistent volume |
| **Realtor.com** | Active buyers | $15-$50 | Lower cost than Zillow in some markets | Lower volume, brand confusion |
| **Google Ads (PPC)** | Active buyers/sellers | $15-$50 | Intent-based, controllable | Requires expertise or agency, competitive keywords |
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | Early-stage buyers/sellers | $5-$25 | Lowest CPL, massive targeting | Low intent, requires long nurture, fair housing ad restrictions |
| **Ylopo** | Buyer leads via Meta + Google | $8-$30 | AI-driven, integrated follow-up | Platform dependency, requires BoldTrail/FUB CRM |

### Compliance Requirements by Prospecting Method

**Cold Calling:**
- Check the National Do Not Call Registry before every call
- FSBO sellers are generally exempt from DNC for 3 months after their listing appears
- Expired listings: check DNC -- listing a property does not create an exemption in most states
- No auto-dialer calls to cell phones without prior express consent (TCPA)
- State-specific rules may be stricter -- verify with your state's real estate commission

**Text Messaging:**
- Written consent required before sending marketing texts (TCPA)
- Single opt-in acceptable for transactional messages; double opt-in recommended for marketing
- Include opt-out mechanism in every message
- No auto-text to numbers without consent (even leads from Zillow -- check platform terms)

**Email Marketing:**
- Physical mailing address required in every email (CAN-SPAM)
- Opt-out mechanism required and must be honored within 10 business days
- Subject lines cannot be misleading
- "From" address must accurately identify the sender
- Brokerage may have additional requirements

**Social Media Advertising:**
- Fair housing compliance: cannot target or exclude by race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, familial status (federal protected classes)
- Meta/Facebook Special Ad Category: housing ads must use Special Ad Category designation, which limits targeting options
- State-specific protected classes may add restrictions
- Brokerage name and license number may be required in ads (varies by state)

### Industry Standards & References

- **Tom Ferry "36-Touch Plan":** Widely adopted SOI touch framework in the industry. 36 annual touches across phone, email, mail, social, and events.
- **TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act):** Federal law governing phone and text solicitation. Enforced by FCC with penalties up to $1,500 per violation.
- **CAN-SPAM Act:** Federal law governing commercial email. Enforced by FTC with penalties up to $51,744 per violation.
- **National Do Not Call Registry:** Managed by FTC. Agents must check before cold calling. Fines up to $51,744 per call.
- **Fair Housing Act / HUD Advertising Guidelines:** Govern all real estate advertising including digital ads, social media, and listing descriptions.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Pragmatic and prioritized. They have limited time and budget. Do not hand them a list of 15 lead sources -- narrow to the 3-4 that match their production level, market, and strengths. Show them the math on each source so they can make informed budget decisions. Push them on consistency: "This only works if you do it every week, not just when your pipeline is empty."

**To team leaders:** Scalable and systems-oriented. They need lead sources that can feed multiple agents, not just themselves. Focus on paid lead platforms (volume), ISA/speed-to-lead infrastructure, and distribution systems. Address per-agent lead cost and accountability: "If you're spending $3,000/month on Zillow leads for 4 agents, what's the minimum closing expectation per agent to justify the spend?"

**To broker/owners:** Strategic and retention-focused. Lead generation programs are recruiting tools. Broker-provided leads justify splits and increase retention. Frame in terms of agent value proposition: "What lead generation support does your brokerage provide that agents cannot get elsewhere?" Address company-level ROI on lead programs.

**To new agents:** Foundational and action-oriented. They have no SOI momentum, no database, and no marketing budget. Start with free: SOI outreach (everyone they know), open houses (other agents' listings), and social media (organic content). Give them a 90-day lead generation boot camp framework. Set expectations: "You will not close a deal from your efforts for 60-120 days. That's normal. The agents who quit prospecting before the pipeline fills are the ones who leave the industry in year one."

---

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: New Agent with No Pipeline

**User says:** "I just got my license and I have zero leads. Where do I start?"

**Actions:**
1. Validate the anxiety -- every successful agent started with zero. The first 90 days are about building the machine, not closing deals.
2. Start with the free and immediate: write down every person they know (friends, family, neighbors, former coworkers, service providers, social media connections). This is their SOI. Most new agents identify 100-250+ people when they actually sit down and list them.
3. Launch the SOI announcement campaign: personal calls (not texts) to their top 50 contacts announcing they are in real estate. Not asking for business -- informing and asking who they know that might need help.
4. Volunteer for open houses: approach top-producing agents in their office and offer to host their open houses. This is the #1 free lead source for new agents. Two open houses per weekend generates 10-40 new contacts per month.
5. Start daily prospecting habits: 90 minutes every morning. 20 calls to SOI contacts (checking in, not selling) + social media engagement + one piece of value content posted.
6. Build the database from day one. Cross-reference `crm-tech-advisor` for CRM selection -- no lead generation strategy works without a CRM.
7. Set the 90-day expectation: "At 90 minutes/day, you'll have 200+ database contacts, 2-4 active buyer or seller leads, and the start of a pipeline. Your first closing will likely come in months 3-5."

### Scenario 2: Agent Over-Reliant on Zillow Leads

**User says:** "I'm spending $2,500/month on Zillow Premier Agent and that's where most of my business comes from. Is that a problem?"

**Actions:**
1. Ask for their numbers: how many Zillow leads per month, how many convert to closings per year, and average GCI per closing from Zillow. Calculate the full picture.
2. Run the math. Example: $30K/year Zillow spend, 180 leads, 5 closings, $8K average GCI = $40K GCI. Cost per closing: $6,000. ROI: ($40K - $30K) / $30K = 33%. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for time-adjusted ROI.
3. Diagnose the dependency: if Zillow represents more than 40% of their closings, they have a concentration risk. Zillow changes pricing, changes their market, or changes the algorithm -- their income drops proportionally.
4. Recommend diversification, not elimination. Do not tell them to cancel Zillow -- it is producing closings. Instead, identify the highest-ROI additions: SOI cultivation (costs $200-$500 per closing vs. Zillow's $6,000), geographic farming (12-month investment, 3-5 year payoff), and open houses.
5. Set a diversification target: within 12 months, Zillow should represent no more than 30-35% of their pipeline. The rest should come from SOI/referrals and proactive prospecting.
6. Address speed-to-lead: if their Zillow conversion rate is below 2%, the issue is likely response time and follow-up, not the leads themselves. Review their process.

### Scenario 3: Agent Asking About Geographic Farming

**User says:** "I want to start farming a neighborhood. I'm looking at a subdivision with about 400 homes. How do I do this?"

**Actions:**
1. Validate the farm size (400 homes is in the ideal range for a solo agent).
2. Run the farm evaluation: what is the annual turnover rate? If 20 homes sold last year, that is 5% turnover -- viable. Is there a dominant agent already capturing 20%+ of those transactions? If yes, pick a different farm. What is the average sale price -- does it align with their target?
3. Lay out the multi-channel plan: monthly direct mail (just-listed/just-sold postcards, quarterly market reports), quarterly door knocking (introduce, deliver value, gather intel), social media geo-targeting (ads and organic content about the neighborhood), and at least one annual neighborhood event (BBQ, holiday drive, school supply collection).
4. Set budget expectations: direct mail at $1-$2 per home per month = $400-$800/month. Door knocking is free but costs 8-12 hours per quarter. Social ads at $100-$300/month for geo-targeting. Total: $500-$1,100/month for the first 12-18 months before meaningful ROI.
5. Set timeline expectations: months 1-6 are brand building -- minimal leads. Months 6-12 bring recognition and the first listing opportunities. By month 12-18, the farm should generate 2-5 listing leads per quarter. Year 2+, the farm becomes self-sustaining with referrals.
6. Recommend tracking: keep a spreadsheet of every contact made, every listing taken, and every closing from the farm. This data proves ROI and guides budget decisions.

### Scenario 4: Team Leader Evaluating Lead Sources for the Team

**User says:** "I run a team of 6 agents. I'm spending $8K/month on online leads. Two of my agents are converting, four are not. What do I do?"

**Actions:**
1. Diagnose the conversion gap: are the non-converting agents receiving the same quality leads, or is distribution uneven? Are they responding within 5 minutes? Do they have a follow-up sequence? Pull the data before making decisions.
2. Implement speed-to-lead accountability: track first-response time for every agent on every lead. Agents consistently responding in over 15 minutes should be removed from the lead rotation until they fix their process. Leads are perishable -- giving them to agents who do not respond promptly is burning money.
3. Evaluate whether the issue is skill or system: do the non-converting agents need scripts and coaching (skill) or do they need auto-responders and a CRM with forced follow-up tasks (system)? Usually both.
4. Consider an ISA (Inside Sales Agent): at $8K/month in lead spend across 6 agents, the math may support a dedicated ISA ($3,000-$5,000/month) whose only job is speed-to-lead response and initial qualification before handing warm leads to agents. This often doubles conversion rates.
5. Run the per-agent economics: if each agent receives $1,333/month in leads and two agents are closing 1-2 deals/month each while four close zero, the team is profitable overall but the cost-per-closing on those four agents is infinite. Either train, redistribute, or cut their lead supply.
6. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for team unit economics and `referral-systems` for supplementing paid leads with lower-cost referral systems.

## Important Caveats

- **TCPA violations carry severe penalties.** Up to $1,500 per unsolicited call or text. Agents must understand consent requirements before any cold calling or texting campaign. When in doubt, do not call or text -- use email or mail instead.
- **Fair housing applies to ALL advertising.** Every social media post, Facebook ad, direct mail piece, and email campaign must comply with federal and state fair housing laws. Meta/Facebook housing ads have specific Special Ad Category requirements that limit targeting. Cross-reference `fair-housing-compliance` for detailed guidance.
- **State-specific rules vary significantly.** Some states have stricter solicitation laws than federal TCPA (California, Florida, others). Advertising disclosure requirements (brokerage name, license number) vary by state. Always verify with your state's real estate commission before launching any prospecting campaign. Varies by state -- verify with your state's real estate commission.
- **This skill provides strategy, not legal compliance advice.** For specific questions about TCPA, CAN-SPAM, DNC, or state advertising rules, agents should consult their broker and/or a real estate attorney.
- **Conversion benchmarks are averages, not guarantees.** An agent's actual conversion rate depends on their market, price point, follow-up consistency, and skill level. Use benchmarks for planning and comparison, not as promises.
- **Online lead platform terms change frequently.** Zillow, Realtor.com, and Meta regularly adjust pricing, lead quality, and distribution models. Advice about specific platform economics may need updating. Always verify current terms directly with the platform.
- **Lead generation connects to multiple skills.** Cross-reference `referral-systems` for SOI and referral partner depth, `crm-tech-advisor` for CRM selection and setup, `financial-performance` for lead source ROI analysis and marketing budget evaluation, and `listing-launch-engine` for content marketing assets.
