## 1. Roofing Systems

### Typical Lifespan by Material

| Material | Expected Lifespan | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| 3-tab asphalt shingle | 15-20 years | Most common in budget/starter homes |
| Architectural (dimensional) asphalt shingle | 25-30 years | Standard in most new construction since ~2000 |
| Metal (standing seam) | 40-70 years | Premium option; increasingly popular |
| Metal (corrugated/screw-down) | 25-40 years | More affordable metal option; fastener maintenance needed |
| Clay/concrete tile | 50-100 years | Common in Southwest, Florida, Mediterranean-style homes |
| Slate | 75-150 years | Premium; regional availability varies |
| Wood shake/shingle | 20-40 years | Fire risk in some jurisdictions; may be prohibited |
| TPO/EPDM (flat roof) | 15-25 years | Common on flat or low-slope sections |
| Built-up (tar and gravel, flat) | 15-25 years | Older flat roof technology |

**Climate impact:** Hot climates (Arizona, Texas, Florida) shorten asphalt lifespan by 20-30%. High-wind and hail-prone areas cause premature failure. Heavy snowfall areas see ice dam damage.

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Annual:** Visual inspection from ground level for missing/damaged shingles, sagging, and debris accumulation
- **Bi-annual:** Gutter cleaning (spring and fall)
- **Every 3-5 years:** Professional roof inspection, especially after major storms
- **As needed:** Replace damaged or missing shingles, repair flashing, clear moss or algae growth

### Red Flags / Warning Signs

- **Curling, buckling, or cupping shingles** -- material is past its useful life
- **Granule loss** (check gutters for granule accumulation) -- protective layer is failing
- **Multiple layers of shingles** -- indicates prior re-roofing without tear-off; adds weight, masks problems, and most codes limit to two layers
- **Daylight visible through roof boards** (from attic) -- structural compromise
- **Sagging roof line** -- structural issue with decking or framing; requires immediate evaluation
- **Staining on interior ceilings or walls** -- active or historic leak
- **Damaged or missing flashing** around chimneys, vents, skylights, valleys -- primary leak source
- **Moss, algae, or lichen growth** -- moisture retention that accelerates deterioration
- **Improper ventilation** (inadequate soffit/ridge vents) -- causes premature shingle failure and ice dams

### Common Defects by Age

- **0-10 years:** Installation defects (improper nailing, missing flashing), storm damage, manufacturer defects
- **10-20 years:** Granule loss begins, flashing deterioration, minor leaks at penetrations
- **20-30 years:** Significant granule loss, curling/cupping, multiple repair patches, increased leak risk
- **30+ years:** End of life for most asphalt; replacement needed

### Replacement Cost Range (2025-2026)

| Scope | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Asphalt shingle (tear-off + install) | $8,000-$20,000 | Varies by size, pitch, layers, region |
| Metal standing seam | $15,000-$35,000 | Higher upfront, lower lifetime cost |
| Tile | $20,000-$50,000 | Heavy; may require structural reinforcement |
| Flat roof (TPO/EPDM) | $5,000-$15,000 | Per section |
| Partial repair/patch | $300-$2,000 | Per occurrence |

### Questions Agents Should Ask

- When was the roof last replaced? (Get the year, not "a few years ago")
- Was the old roof removed or was new material installed over it? (Layers matter)
- Has there been any storm damage or insurance claims on the roof?
- Are there any known leaks, past or present?
- Who installed the roof? Is there a transferable warranty?
- Has the attic been inspected for signs of water intrusion?

- **Uneven heating/cooling** between rooms -- duct issues, zoning problems, or inadequate capacity
- **Visible rust or corrosion** on the furnace or heat exchanger
- **Cracked heat exchanger** -- carbon monoxide risk; immediate replacement required
- **Refrigerant leaks** (ice on AC lines) -- expensive to repair on older R-22 systems (phased out)
- **R-22 (Freon) refrigerant system** -- R-22 is no longer manufactured; replacement costs are extreme; system replacement is more economical
- **Yellow or flickering burner flame** (should be steady blue) -- combustion issue
- **High utility bills** relative to similar homes -- system inefficiency

### Common Defects by Age

- **0-5 years:** Installation defects (improper sizing, duct leaks, refrigerant charge)
- **5-10 years:** Capacitor failure, contactor wear, thermostat issues
- **10-15 years:** Compressor stress, blower motor wear, declining efficiency (15-25% loss)
- **15-20 years:** Major component failures, heat exchanger cracks, compressor failure
- **20+ years:** End of life; repair costs exceed replacement value

### Replacement Cost Range (2025-2026)

| System | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Central AC only | $3,500-$8,000 | Condenser + coil |
| Gas furnace only | $2,500-$7,000 | Unit + installation |
| Full system (AC + furnace) | $7,000-$15,000 | Most common replacement scope |
| Heat pump system | $5,000-$12,000 | Increasingly popular; qualifies for tax credits |
| Mini-split (single zone) | $3,000-$6,000 | Per zone |
| Ductwork replacement | $5,000-$15,000 | Rarely needed unless severely damaged |

### SEER Rating Context

| Era | Typical SEER | Current Minimum | High Efficiency |
|-----|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Pre-2006 | 8-10 | N/A (legacy) | N/A |
| 2006-2015 | 13-14 | 13 (was minimum) | 16+ |
| 2015-2023 | 14-16 | 14 (was minimum) | 18+ |
| 2023-Present | 15+ | 15 (current minimum, South) / 14 (North) | 20-24 |

A 2006-era system at SEER 10 uses roughly 50% more energy than a current SEER 15 unit for the same cooling output.

### Questions Agents Should Ask

- How old are the furnace and AC unit? (Check the data plate for manufacture date)
- When was the system last serviced? Is there a maintenance history?
- What type of refrigerant does the AC use? (R-22 is a red flag)
- Has the heat exchanger been inspected recently?
- Are there any rooms that do not heat or cool well?
- Has the ductwork been cleaned or sealed?

- **Vermiculite insulation** -- may contain asbestos (Zonolite brand from Libby, Montana); do not disturb; test before removal
- **Urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI)** -- 1970s product; off-gassing concerns; largely stabilized by now but can affect sale perception
- **Ice dams in winter** -- insufficient attic insulation and/or ventilation
- **Excessive attic heat in summer** -- inadequate ventilation (soffit vents, ridge vent, gable vents)
- **Moisture or mold in attic** -- ventilation failure or bathroom exhaust fan vented into attic (common defect)
- **Bathroom fans venting into attic** instead of to exterior -- moisture and mold source

### Questions Agents Should Ask

- What type of insulation is in the attic? How deep is it?
- Has insulation been added or upgraded?
- Is there insulation in the exterior walls? (Older homes often have none)
- Do bathroom exhaust fans vent to the exterior or into the attic?
- Is there adequate attic ventilation (soffit vents + ridge vent)?
- Has the home had an energy audit?

## 10. Environmental Hazards

### Lead Paint (Pre-1978 Homes)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Risk threshold** | Homes built before 1978 are presumed to contain lead paint |
| **Disclosure requirement** | Federal law (42 U.S.C. 4852d) requires sellers of pre-1978 homes to provide EPA pamphlet, disclose known lead paint, and allow 10-day testing period |
| **Health risk** | Lead poisoning primarily affects children under 6; neurological damage, developmental delays |
| **When it is dangerous** | When paint is disturbed (peeling, chipping, sanding, renovation). Intact lead paint is generally manageable. |
| **Testing** | XRF testing ($300-$600 for whole home) or lab analysis of paint chips |
| **Remediation options** | Encapsulation (paint over with encapsulant: $5-$15/sq ft), removal (expensive: $10-$30/sq ft), replacement of painted components |
| **Renovation rule** | EPA RRP Rule: contractors disturbing more than 6 sq ft of lead paint (interior) or 20 sq ft (exterior) must be EPA-certified |
| **Lending implications** | FHA and VA require peeling paint to be stabilized in pre-1978 homes before closing |

### Asbestos (Pre-1980 Homes, Some Materials Through 1990s)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Common locations** | Insulation (pipe wrap, vermiculite, boiler), floor tiles (9"x9" vinyl), siding (cement-fiber shingles), popcorn ceilings (pre-1980), roofing materials, joint compound |
| **Health risk** | Mesothelioma and lung cancer from prolonged inhalation of airborne fibers |
| **When it is dangerous** | Only when disturbed (friable -- crumbling or damaged). Intact, undisturbed asbestos materials are generally safe to leave in place. |
| **Testing** | Laboratory analysis of material sample ($25-$75 per sample; must be collected properly) |
| **Remediation** | Encapsulation (sealing intact material: $2-$6/sq ft) or removal (by licensed abatement contractor: $15-$65/sq ft; highly regulated) |
| **Disclosure** | Most states require disclosure of known asbestos. Some states require testing or disclosure of likelihood based on age. |
| **Agent guidance** | Never tell a client asbestos is "not a big deal." Also never tell them they must remove it. Recommend testing, present options, let them make an informed decision. |

### Radon

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **What it is** | Naturally occurring radioactive gas from uranium decay in soil; enters through foundation cracks and gaps |
| **EPA action level** | 4.0 pCi/L (picocuries per liter of air) |
| **Health risk** | Second leading cause of lung cancer (after smoking); ~21,000 deaths/year in the US |
| **High-risk regions** | Upper Midwest, Northeast, Appalachian region, Rocky Mountains; but elevated levels can occur anywhere |
| **Testing** | Short-term (48-hour charcoal canister or CRM: $100-$200) or long-term (90+ day alpha track: $25-$50 for kit) |
| **Mitigation** | Sub-slab depressurization system: $800-$2,500 installed; reduces levels 80-99% |
| **Disclosure** | Varies by state. Some require testing or disclosure of known levels. Some require mitigation above action level. |
| **Post-mitigation** | Re-test to confirm levels below 4.0 pCi/L. System runs continuously with minimal electricity cost ($50-$100/year). |

### Mold

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **When it is a problem** | When visible mold covers a large area (>10 sq ft), when mold is in HVAC system, when occupants have health symptoms, or when the moisture source is unresolved |
| **Common causes** | Plumbing leaks, roof leaks, poor ventilation, high humidity, flooding, condensation |
| **Testing** | Air quality testing ($300-$600 per assessment); not always necessary if mold is visible and source is identified |
| **Remediation** | Small areas (<10 sq ft): DIY with proper PPE. Large areas: licensed mold remediation contractor ($1,000-$10,000+ depending on scope) |
| **Key principle** | Mold remediation without fixing the moisture source is pointless. The mold will return. Always identify and resolve the water/moisture source first. |
| **Disclosure** | Most states require disclosure of known mold. Some states (like California) have extensive mold disclosure requirements. |
| **Agent guidance** | Do not use the word "toxic mold" -- all molds can cause health effects in sensitive individuals. Frame as a moisture problem with a remediation solution. |

### Pre-Listing Improvement Priority (Best Sequence for Sellers)

1. **Deep clean and declutter** -- $0-$500 (DIY) or $500-$2,000 (professional) -- highest impact-per-dollar
2. **Repair known defects** -- fix leaky faucets, sticky doors, cracked outlets, missing caulk -- $200-$1,000
3. **Interior paint** (neutral palette) -- $2,000-$5,000 -- transforms dated homes
4. **Curb appeal** -- landscaping cleanup, mulch, front door paint, new house numbers -- $500-$3,000
5. **Flooring refresh** -- clean carpets or replace if stained/worn; refinish hardwood if needed -- $1,000-$5,000
6. **Kitchen refresh** (not remodel) -- new hardware, light fixtures, paint cabinets, update backsplash -- $1,000-$5,000
7. **Bathroom refresh** -- new fixtures, mirrors, hardware, re-caulk, fresh paint -- $500-$3,000
8. **Lighting update** -- replace dated fixtures with modern options -- $500-$2,000

**Total pre-listing budget for maximum impact: $5,000-$15,000**

This targeted approach consistently outperforms major renovations in terms of ROI for selling. The goal is to remove objections and present a move-in-ready appearance, not to create a dream home.
