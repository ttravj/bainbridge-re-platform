# Onboarding & Training

The skill that determines whether new agents survive their first year and whether teams develop consistent production instead of chronic turnover. Real estate has a brutal attrition problem: roughly 75-80% of new agents fail within the first two years, and poor onboarding is the single most controllable factor. A brokerage or team that invests in structured onboarding, skills-based training, competency assessment, and niche specialization development produces agents who close faster, stay longer, and build sustainable businesses. This skill creates training materials, onboarding programs, mentorship structures, skills assessments, and niche-specific education modules for agents at every stage -- from pre-license orientation to advanced specialization.

## Core Principles

1. **Structure prevents failure.** The number one reason new agents fail is not lack of talent -- it is lack of structure. Agents who receive no onboarding plan, no daily activity expectations, no transaction support, and no accountability system are set up to fail. Every onboarding program must provide a clear, day-by-day framework for the first 90 days that eliminates the question "what should I be doing right now?" A new agent who knows exactly what to do on Day 14 will outproduce a naturally talented agent who wakes up with no plan.
2. **Training must produce behavior, not just knowledge.** The industry is drowning in educational content -- webinars, courses, podcasts, certifications. Most of it creates informed agents who still cannot prospect, convert a lead, or manage a transaction. Effective training ties every knowledge module to a specific, measurable behavior: after this module, the agent will be able to conduct a buyer consultation using the post-settlement framework and secure a signed buyer agency agreement. If the training does not change what the agent does on Monday morning, it failed.
3. **Niche expertise is a competitive advantage, not a luxury.** Generalist agents compete on availability and price. Specialists compete on knowledge and command premium fees. Every training program should help agents identify and develop niche expertise -- whether luxury, military/VA, investment, seniors, or geographic farming -- because specialization is how agents escape the commodity trap and build referral-based businesses.

## Instructions

### How to Respond to Onboarding & Training Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: New Agent Onboarding Program Design

Includes: new agent onboarding, 90-day plan, first-day orientation, what to teach new agents, onboarding checklist, setting up a new agent for success.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask for (or estimate from context): brokerage or team size, who is being onboarded (brand-new agent, experienced agent switching brokerages, agent joining a team), available support resources (mentor, TC, office manager), and technology stack.
2. Build the 90-day onboarding framework with three distinct phases. **Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation.** Compliance orientation (license activation, E&O coverage, MLS access, key access, association fees, post-settlement rules), systems training (CRM setup, transaction management platform, email/calendar configuration, lockbox/showing systems), scripts and dialogues practice (buyer consultation, listing presentation, sphere outreach, lead follow-up), first SOI outreach campaign (minimum 100 contacts announced), daily prospecting habits established (2 hours minimum). **Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Activation.** First buyer consultation (shadowed by mentor), first listing appointment (shadowed), open house execution (minimum 2), lead conversion practice with role-play, transaction management walkthrough with a live file (mentor's or TC-guided), goal setting and business plan creation. Cross-reference `business-planner` for the planning framework. **Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Production.** First independent buyer or listing under mentor supervision, weekly KPI review (contacts, appointments, showings, offers), mid-course correction on lead sources and activities, advanced training on negotiation, pricing, and market analysis, graduation criteria and transition to ongoing accountability.
3. Include specific daily schedules for Week 1. New agents need hour-by-hour structure in the first five days: 8:00 AM arrival, 8:30 compliance paperwork, 9:30 CRM training, 10:30 script practice, 11:30 shadow experienced agent on phone calls, 1:00 PM mentor ride-along, 3:00 PM role-play, 4:00 PM homework assignment. Agents left to "figure it out" on Day 1 often never come back on Day 2.
4. For experienced agents switching brokerages: compress Phase 1 to one week (systems and compliance only), skip foundational scripts, focus on the brokerage-specific tools, culture, and any post-settlement compliance updates the agent may have missed. Pair with a peer buddy, not a mentor -- experienced agents resent being treated like rookies.
5. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for the compliance orientation content and `commission-strategy` for post-settlement commission training that must be part of every onboarding program.

#### Category B: Team Training Curriculum Design

Includes: team training program, weekly training topics, how to train my team, training schedule, team education, skills development, what to train on.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask for (or estimate from context): team size, experience mix (new vs. experienced agents), current pain points (conversion rates, lead follow-up, listing presentations, negotiation), and training format preferences (in-person, virtual, self-paced, group).
2. Design a 52-week training curriculum organized into monthly themes. Each month focuses on one core competency with weekly sessions building depth:
   - **Month 1:** Post-settlement commission conversations and buyer agency agreements (cross-reference `commission-strategy`)
   - **Month 2:** Buyer consultation and representation workflow (cross-reference `buyer-representation`)
   - **Month 3:** Listing presentation and pricing strategy (cross-reference `listing-services`, `cma-generator`)
   - **Month 4:** Lead generation and database management (cross-reference `lead-generation`)
   - **Month 5:** Negotiation and offer writing (cross-reference `negotiation-strategy`, `offer-writer`)
   - **Month 6:** Contract-to-close and transaction management (cross-reference `transaction-coordinator`)
   - **Month 7:** Marketing and listing launch execution (cross-reference `listing-launch-engine`)
   - **Month 8:** Financial performance and business planning (cross-reference `financial-performance`, `business-planner`)
   - **Month 9:** Client communication and difficult conversations (cross-reference `client-communication`)
   - **Month 10:** Compliance, fair housing, and risk management (cross-reference `compliance-navigator`, `fair-housing-compliance`)
   - **Month 11:** Niche specialization deep dive (agent's choice -- see `references/niche-specializations.md`)
   - **Month 12:** Annual planning, goal setting, and accountability systems
3. Each weekly session should follow a consistent format: 15-minute market update, 30-minute topic instruction, 15-minute role-play or case study. Total: 60 minutes. This is non-negotiable -- training that runs over 90 minutes loses the room.
4. Include accountability mechanisms: agents must demonstrate competency through role-play pass-offs, not just attendance. A buyer consultation role-play is "passed" when the agent can complete the full consultation without script, handle three common objections, and secure the buyer agency agreement.
5. For mixed-experience teams: run foundational sessions for all, then break into advanced tracks for experienced agents (niche development, team leadership, advanced negotiation) while newer agents continue with fundamentals.

#### Category C: Mentorship Program Design

Includes: mentorship program, mentor-mentee pairing, how to mentor a new agent, mentoring structure, accountability for new agents.

**Workflow:**
1. Design a structured mentorship program, not an informal "call me if you need anything" arrangement. Informal mentorship fails because new agents do not know what questions to ask and experienced agents get busy.
2. Define the mentor role clearly: the mentor is not the agent's manager, lead provider, or babysitter. The mentor provides transaction guidance, role-play practice, field accompaniment (shadowing appointments), and emotional support through the inevitable early rejections. The mentor does NOT do the agent's work for them.
3. Set the meeting cadence: weekly 30-minute scheduled meetings (non-negotiable, on the calendar), plus real-time availability for urgent transaction questions. The weekly meeting agenda should be structured: (a) wins from last week, (b) challenges/stuck points, (c) upcoming activities and support needed, (d) one skill focus for the week.
4. Compensation for mentors: most teams and brokerages ask experienced agents to mentor without compensation. This produces resentful mentors and inconsistent mentoring. Recommended models: (a) mentor receives a referral fee (25-30%) on the mentee's first 2-3 transactions the mentor directly supports, (b) brokerage provides a monthly stipend ($200-$500) or reduced desk fee, (c) mentor's mentoring performance is factored into recognition programs or award criteria.
5. Define graduation criteria: the mentee "graduates" when they have completed 3-5 independent transactions without mentor intervention, passed all role-play competency assessments, and demonstrated consistent daily prospecting behavior for 60+ days. Set expectations upfront: mentorship lasts 6-12 months, not indefinitely.

#### Category D: Skills Assessment & Competency Mapping

Includes: skills assessment, competency evaluation, what does my agent need to improve, performance gap analysis, agent development plan, how do I know if my agent is ready.

**Workflow:**
1. Use the competency framework to assess agents across 8 core skill areas. Rate each 1-5 (1 = cannot perform, 3 = can perform with guidance, 5 = can perform independently and teach others):

| Skill Area | Assessment Criteria |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Prospecting & Lead Generation | Daily contacts, SOI cultivation, lead follow-up speed, conversion rate |
| Buyer Representation | Consultation quality, agreement signing rate, showing efficiency, offer preparation |
| Listing Acquisition | Presentation quality, pricing accuracy, listing-to-appointment ratio, marketing execution |
| Negotiation | Counter-offer strategy, inspection response, appraisal gap handling, win-win outcomes |
| Transaction Management | Deadline adherence, document accuracy, problem resolution, closing on-time rate |
| Client Communication | Responsiveness, expectation setting, difficult conversation handling, post-close follow-up |
| Compliance & Ethics | Disclosure completeness, fair housing adherence, post-settlement compliance, record keeping |
| Business Management | Financial tracking, goal setting, time management, strategic planning |

2. Identify the two lowest-scoring areas and build a targeted 30-day development plan for each: specific training modules, practice exercises, role-play scenarios, and measurable improvement targets.
3. Reassess quarterly. Agents should show improvement of at least 1 point in targeted areas within 90 days. If no improvement after two quarters despite training investment, the issue may be effort or fit rather than skill.
4. For team leaders evaluating whether an agent is ready for independence (graduating from mentorship, handling transactions solo, or taking on a specialized role): the agent must score 3+ in all eight areas and 4+ in at least four. Any area scoring below 3 requires continued support.

#### Category E: Niche Specialization Training

Includes: luxury training, VA buyer training, first-time buyer training, investment property training, seniors training, probate, divorce real estate, new construction, relocation, geographic farming, niche development.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the target niche. If the agent has not chosen one, help them evaluate based on: local market opportunity (which niches have underserved demand), personal interest and background (military veterans gravitate to VA, for example), income potential (luxury has higher per-transaction GCI but lower volume), and certification requirements.
2. Pull the relevant niche module from `references/niche-specializations.md` and build a customized training plan covering: required knowledge areas, recommended certifications/designations, marketing approach, client communication style, common pitfalls, and skills to develop.
3. Structure the niche development as a 90-day specialization sprint: **Month 1** -- knowledge acquisition (study the niche reference material, complete any prerequisite courses, shadow a specialist if possible). **Month 2** -- certification pursuit (enroll in the relevant designation course, begin building niche-specific marketing materials). **Month 3** -- market entry (launch niche-targeted marketing, attend niche-specific networking events, pursue first niche client).
4. Emphasize that niche expertise compounds over time. The first year in a niche is investment. By year 2-3, the agent becomes the known specialist and referrals flow. Agents who abandon a niche after 6 months because "it's not working yet" never reach the payoff.
5. For niches with legal complexity (divorce, probate, 1031 exchanges): training must include the boundaries of the agent's role. Agents are not attorneys, tax advisors, or therapists. Knowing where the agent's expertise ends and professional referrals begin is as important as knowing the niche itself.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### The 90-Day Onboarding Framework

| Phase | Days | Focus | Graduation Criteria |
|-------|------|-------|-------------------|
| Foundation | 1-30 | Compliance, systems, scripts, SOI launch | CRM loaded with 100+ contacts, can recite buyer/seller consultation scripts, passed compliance quiz |
| Activation | 31-60 | First appointments (shadowed), open houses, lead conversion, business plan | Completed 2+ open houses, attended 3+ appointments with mentor, business plan drafted |
| Production | 61-90 | Independent transactions, KPI tracking, advanced skills | 1+ transaction under contract or closed, hitting daily prospecting targets, mentor sign-off |

### New Agent Failure Points

Understanding why agents fail is essential to designing onboarding that prevents failure:

| Failure Point | Frequency | Prevention |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| No daily activity plan | Very common | Day-by-day schedule for first 30 days, non-negotiable prospecting block |
| No SOI outreach in first 2 weeks | Very common | Require 100-contact announcement within 10 days of license activation |
| Fear of phone/prospecting | Common | Daily role-play, incremental exposure (texts first, then calls, then in-person) |
| No transaction support on first deal | Common | Assigned mentor walks through first 3 transactions step-by-step |
| Financial runway too short | Common | Pre-onboarding financial counseling: 6-month expense reserve required |
| Wrong brokerage fit | Moderate | Pre-hire expectation setting, cross-reference `brokerage-evaluator` |
| No business plan | Very common | Business plan required by Day 45, cross-reference `business-planner` |

### Training Delivery Best Practices

- **Role-play is non-negotiable.** Agents who role-play weekly convert at 2-3x the rate of agents who only study scripts. Every training session should include at least 15 minutes of role-play. Pair agents of similar experience levels for practice, then have them perform for the group.
- **Case studies beat lectures.** Present a real scenario (anonymized): "The inspection came back with foundation issues. The buyer wants to cancel. The seller refuses to repair. What do you do?" Walk through the response as a group. This teaches critical thinking, not just memorization.
- **Record and review.** Have agents record their buyer consultations, listing presentations, and phone prospecting (with appropriate consent). Review recordings in 1:1s. Agents are often unaware of verbal tics, missed transitions, or weak closes until they hear themselves.
- **Spaced repetition over marathon sessions.** A 60-minute weekly session with daily 15-minute practice produces better retention than a 4-hour monthly workshop. Training must be frequent and brief.
- **Certify, do not just attend.** Attendance is not competency. Implement pass-off requirements: the agent must demonstrate the skill in a role-play evaluation before they are cleared to perform it with a live client.

### Designation & Certification Overview

| Designation | Full Name | Niche | Requirements | Value |
|------------|-----------|-------|--------------|-------|
| ABR | Accredited Buyer's Representative | Buyer representation | 2-day course + 5 transactions | Moderate -- post-settlement relevance increasing |
| SRS | Seller Representative Specialist | Listing/seller | 2-day course + exam | Moderate -- differentiator for listing agents |
| CRS | Certified Residential Specialist | General production | 25+ transactions + education | High -- top 3% of agents hold CRS |
| GRI | Graduate, REALTOR Institute | General | 60+ hours coursework | Moderate -- broad foundational knowledge |
| SRES | Seniors Real Estate Specialist | Seniors/downsizers | 2-day course + exam | High for niche -- growing demographic |
| MRP | Military Relocation Professional | Military/VA | 1-day course + exam | High for niche -- underserved market |
| CLHMS | Certified Luxury Home Marketing Specialist | Luxury ($1M+) | Production threshold + course | High for niche -- required credibility marker |
| CRP | Certified Relocation Professional | Relocation | Course + experience | High for corporate relocation referrals |
| CCIM | Certified Commercial Investment Member | Investment | 200+ hours + portfolio | Very high but investment-heavy -- primarily commercial |
| e-PRO | e-PRO Certification | Digital marketing | Online course | Low -- more relevant as continuing education credit |

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Focus on self-directed learning and niche development. Solo agents seeking training content are usually trying to level up in a specific area -- help them build a focused development plan rather than a broad curriculum. Recommend specific designations, study resources, and practice methods they can execute independently. Cross-reference specific skills for deep-dive content in their target area.

**To team leaders:** Operational and systematic. They need training programs that can be replicated across multiple hires without depending on the leader's personal time for every session. Emphasize scalable curriculum design, role-play-based competency assessments, and accountability systems that run without constant leader involvement. The best team training programs function when the leader is out of the office for a week.

**To broker/owners:** Strategic and retention-focused. Training is the number one retention tool and the number one recruiting differentiator after economics. Brokerages that invest $2,000-$5,000 per agent in structured onboarding see 40-60% better first-year retention. Frame training as an investment with measurable ROI: retained agents, faster time-to-first-transaction, higher per-agent production, reduced liability through compliance training. Help them build training infrastructure that scales across 20, 50, or 200 agents.

**To new agents:** Encouraging but direct. They need to hear that the first year is hard, that 75-80% of their peers will not make it, and that the difference between those who survive and those who do not is almost entirely effort and structure. Give them the structure. Tell them exactly what to do each day. Do not overwhelm with theory -- give them the script, the schedule, and the accountability system. They can learn the "why" once they are producing.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Broker Designing a New Agent Onboarding Program

**User says:** "I run a brokerage with 40 agents. We lose half our new hires in the first year. I need a real onboarding program, not just a welcome packet."

**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge the problem directly: a 50% first-year attrition rate means the brokerage is spending $5K-$10K per lost agent in recruiting, onboarding, and lost productivity. At 10 new hires per year losing 5, that is $25K-$50K in annual waste -- before counting the opportunity cost of deals those agents could have closed.
2. Build the full 90-day onboarding framework (see Category A). Include Week 1 day-by-day schedule, Phase 1/2/3 milestones, and graduation criteria.
3. Design the mentorship component: pair each new agent with a producing agent (15+ transactions/year) who receives compensation for mentoring. Structure the mentor relationship with weekly meetings, shadow requirements, and first-transaction support.
4. Include the competency assessment framework (see Category D). Assess new agents at Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90. Agents not meeting Phase 1 benchmarks by Day 30 need immediate intervention -- additional role-play, daily check-ins, or an honest conversation about fit.
5. Recommend tracking the key retention metric: time-to-first-transaction. The industry average for new agents is 4-6 months. With structured onboarding, target 60-90 days. Every month shaved off this number reduces attrition.
6. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for the compliance training module and `commission-strategy` for the mandatory post-settlement training component.

### Scenario 2: Team Leader Building Weekly Training for a Mixed-Experience Team

**User says:** "I have a team of 6 agents -- 2 are brand new, 2 have about 2 years of experience, and 2 are top producers. Our weekly meetings are boring and nobody pays attention. How do I make training useful for everyone?"

**Actions:**
1. Diagnose the problem: a single training session that serves agents at three different experience levels serves none of them well. New agents need fundamentals. Mid-level agents need advanced skill refinement. Top producers need strategic and niche development.
2. Restructure the weekly meeting into two parts. **Part 1 (30 minutes, full team):** Market update (10 min), case study discussion from a real current transaction (15 min), recognition/wins (5 min). Everyone participates because market data and real scenarios are relevant at every level. **Part 2 (30 minutes, split tracks):** New agents do role-play and script practice with each other or the team leader. Mid-level agents work on an advanced topic (negotiation scenarios, CMA deep dive, listing presentation refinement). Top producers do peer strategy sessions or niche specialization development.
3. Assign monthly topic ownership to the experienced agents. Nothing teaches like teaching. Have each top producer lead one training session per quarter on their strongest skill. This elevates their status, reinforces their expertise, and gives the newer agents a role model.
4. Implement the pass-off system: new agents must pass a role-play evaluation on each core skill before they are cleared to perform it live. Buyer consultation pass-off, listing presentation pass-off, phone prospecting pass-off, negotiation pass-off. This creates measurable competency standards, not just attendance records.
5. Cross-reference the 52-week curriculum outline (Category B) and customize the monthly themes to the team's specific weaknesses. If conversion is the team's biggest gap, front-load months 1-3 with prospecting, consultation, and conversion training rather than following the default sequence.

### Scenario 3: Agent Seeking Niche Specialization Training

**User says:** "I've been a generalist for three years, closing about 15 deals a year. I want to specialize in luxury real estate. Where do I start?"

**Actions:**
1. Assess readiness: at 15 deals/year as a generalist, the agent has a solid production foundation. Luxury is a viable niche but requires different skills and longer ramp-up than most niches -- luxury cycles are slower (90-180+ days average), marketing costs are higher, and credibility expectations are steep.
2. Pull the luxury niche module from `references/niche-specializations.md` and walk through the knowledge requirements: pricing at the high end (CMA methodology differs above $1M), luxury marketing channels (print media, private events, international portals), high-net-worth client psychology (privacy, discretion, they are interviewing you as much as you are pitching them), and property-specific knowledge (architectural styles, custom home features, land and estate considerations).
3. Build the 90-day specialization sprint: **Month 1** -- complete the CLHMS designation course (required credibility marker in luxury), study luxury market data in the target area (which neighborhoods, who is buying, price trends), shadow a luxury agent on 2-3 showings or listing appointments if possible. **Month 2** -- develop luxury marketing materials (presentations, digital presence upgrade, professional headshots and branding aligned to luxury positioning), begin attending luxury-relevant networking events (charity galas, country club events, business networking groups). **Month 3** -- launch luxury-targeted marketing (geographic farm in a luxury neighborhood, social media content showcasing high-end properties and lifestyle), pursue a luxury listing (may require a co-list with an established luxury agent for the first one).
4. Set realistic expectations: the luxury niche typically takes 12-18 months to produce consistent income. The first year is investment. The agent should maintain their general business while building the luxury pipeline -- do not abandon 15 transactions/year of reliable income for a niche that may not produce for a year.
5. Cross-reference `listing-services` for luxury listing strategy, `listing-launch-engine` for luxury property marketing, and `value-proposition-builder` for the luxury buyer/seller presentation.

### Scenario 4: Brokerage Creating a Mentorship Program from Scratch

**User says:** "My experienced agents say they are too busy to mentor. How do I build a mentorship program that people actually participate in?"

**Actions:**
1. Address the root problem: "too busy" means "not incentivized." Experienced agents earn $200-$500/hour in production activities. Asking them to donate hours to mentoring without compensation is asking them to lose money. The brokerage must fund the mentorship program.
2. Present three compensation models: (a) referral fee structure -- the mentor receives 25-30% of the mentee's first 3 transactions that the mentor directly supports with significant guidance. This is self-funding and aligns incentives because the mentor earns more when the mentee succeeds. (b) Monthly stipend -- $300-$500/month for the mentoring commitment (4-5 hours/month). Funded by the brokerage from the company dollar earned on mentee transactions. (c) Reduced brokerage fees -- mentor receives a per-transaction fee discount or desk fee reduction during the mentoring period.
3. Structure the program to minimize mentor time commitment: weekly 30-minute scheduled calls (not open-ended), structured agenda templates so the mentor does not have to prepare, clear scope boundaries (mentor handles questions and role-play, not paperwork or lead generation for the mentee).
4. Define mentor selection criteria: 3+ years experience, 15+ transactions/year, clean compliance record, willingness to commit for 6-12 months, and -- critically -- the ability to teach, not just produce. The best agent is not always the best mentor. Look for agents who can explain their process, not just execute it.
5. Set measurable outcomes: track mentee time-to-first-transaction, mentee retention rate at 12 months, and mentee production at 12 months. Compare mentored agents to non-mentored agents. This data justifies continued investment in the program.

## Important Caveats

- **Continuing education requirements vary significantly by state.** Hours, topics, cycle length, and mandatory subjects differ across all 50 states. Always verify current CE requirements with the applicable state real estate commission before building compliance training content. Varies by state -- verify with your state's real estate commission.
- **Designation and certification requirements change.** Course availability, prerequisites, costs, and maintenance requirements are set by the issuing organizations (NAR, ILHM, etc.) and may change. Verify current requirements before recommending a specific designation pathway.
- **This skill does not replace professional licensing education.** Pre-license courses, post-license education, and CE courses must be delivered by state-approved providers. Training created using this skill is supplemental to, not a substitute for, required licensing education.
- **Agent classification (IC vs. employee) affects training structure.** Mandatory training requirements, scheduled training sessions, and required attendance can affect independent contractor classification in some jurisdictions. Brokerages should consult an employment attorney to ensure training programs do not inadvertently create an employer-employee relationship with IC agents. Cross-reference `team-management` for IC classification guidance.
- **Niche specialization content in this skill and its reference files provides foundational knowledge, not legal, tax, or financial advice.** Agents specializing in divorce, probate, 1031 exchanges, VA loans, or other legally complex niches must partner with attorneys, CPAs, and other licensed professionals. The agent's role is real estate expertise within the transaction -- not legal counsel, tax planning, or therapeutic support.
- **This skill connects to `compliance-navigator` for regulatory training content, `commission-strategy` for post-settlement commission training, `buyer-representation` and `listing-services` for transaction skill development, `team-management` for team training infrastructure, and `brokerage-evaluator` for helping agents evaluate the training quality of brokerages.**
