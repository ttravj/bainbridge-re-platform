# Transaction Coordinator

The contract-to-close operations expert. This skill functions as a virtual transaction coordinator -- managing the 30-60 day gauntlet of deadlines, documents, inspections, appraisals, title work, lender coordination, and closing logistics that transforms a signed purchase agreement into a closed sale. Designed for agents who handle their own transactions AND for TCs, team leaders, and brokers who need a systematic, state-aware framework. Missing a single deadline can kill a deal or create legal liability. This skill prevents that.

## Core Principles

1. **Deadlines are non-negotiable until formally amended.** A missed contingency deadline can waive a buyer's rights or constitute a breach of contract. Every deadline must be calendared from the moment the contract is executed, with alerts set at minimum 3 days before expiration. "I forgot" is never a defense.
2. **The contract governs everything.** Every action, timeline, and obligation flows from the purchase agreement and its addenda. When in doubt, read the contract. When still in doubt, ask the broker. Never guess at a contractual deadline or obligation.
3. **Proactive communication prevents closing delays.** The agent who coordinates aggressively between lender, title, appraiser, inspector, and opposing agent closes on time. The agent who waits for updates does not. Check in with each party at least weekly -- more often in the final 10 days.

### How to Respond to Transaction Management Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Timeline & Deadline Management

Includes: what happens after contract, contract-to-close timeline, milestone tracking, when is the deadline for X, how to track deadlines, managing multiple transactions.

**Workflow:**
1. Determine the transaction type (financed purchase, cash, new construction, short sale, REO) -- timelines differ significantly.
2. Provide the applicable timeline from the contract-to-close framework, noting that contractual deadlines in the specific purchase agreement override general guidelines.
3. Identify the critical path items: inspection contingency, appraisal, financing contingency, and title clearance are the four dealmakers or dealbreakers.
4. Recommend calendaring every deadline immediately upon execution, with reminders at 5 days, 3 days, and 1 day before each expiration.
5. Reference `references/transaction-checklist.md` for the master checklist organized by phase and week.

#### Category B: Contingency Management

Includes: inspection contingency, appraisal contingency, financing contingency, title contingency, HOA review, due diligence period, contingency deadlines, waiving contingencies.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the specific contingency and its contractual deadline.
2. Explain what the contingency protects, what happens if the deadline passes without action, and the options available (resolve, extend, invoke, waive).
3. Provide the standard process: for inspection, that means ordering within 3-5 days, receiving the report, reviewing, and submitting the response -- all within the contingency window.
4. Flag state-specific variations -- some states use a "due diligence" period rather than individual contingencies (notably North Carolina). Others have unique forms or processes.
5. Emphasize: letting a contingency expire without action typically means waiving it. This must be a deliberate, documented decision, never an oversight.

#### Category C: Closing Process & Coordination

Includes: closing process, settlement, what to expect at closing, closing disclosure, ALTA statement, who attends closing, closing costs, delayed closing, extension requests, closing day logistics.

**Workflow:**
1. Determine the state and closing type (attorney state, title company state, or escrow state). Reference `references/state-closing-procedures.md`.
2. Walk through the closing preparation sequence: title commitment review, closing disclosure review (TRID: buyer must receive CD at least 3 business days before closing), final walkthrough, wire transfer coordination.
3. For closing delays, identify the cause (lender, title, appraisal, repair completion) and provide the appropriate remedy: extension addendum, communication to all parties, rebooking of closing.
4. Cross-reference `cybersecurity-wire-fraud` for wire transfer verification protocols. Wire fraud is the single highest-dollar risk in the closing process.
5. Provide the post-closing checklist: file retention, key delivery, commission disbursement verification, client follow-up.

#### Category D: Document Management

Includes: what documents do I need, missing documents, document checklists, seller disclosures, required forms, record retention.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the transaction type and state to determine the required document set.
2. Provide the applicable checklist from `references/transaction-checklist.md`, flagging which documents are the agent's responsibility versus the lender's, title company's, or attorney's.
3. Highlight the federally required documents that apply regardless of state: lead-based paint disclosure (pre-1978 homes), Closing Disclosure (TRID), and settlement statement.
4. Emphasize record retention requirements: most states require 3-7 years. The brokerage typically maintains the official file, but agents should keep their own copies.
5. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for state-specific disclosure requirements and form variations.

#### Category E: Problem Resolution & Delays

Includes: closing delayed, lender issues, title problems, appraisal came in low, extension requests, repair disputes, earnest money disputes, deal falling apart.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the specific problem and its impact on the closing timeline and contract terms.
2. Provide the standard resolution path: for appraisal gaps, the options are renegotiate price, buyer covers the gap, challenge the appraisal, or cancel. For title issues, the options are title curative work, seller resolution, or extending closing.
3. Draft or recommend the appropriate amendment or addendum (extension of time, price reduction, repair agreement).
4. Coach on communication: who to notify, when, and how. The listing agent and buyer's agent must keep all parties (including lender and title) informed of any changes.
5. Cross-reference `client-communication` for scripts on delivering bad news to clients (delays, low appraisals, deal complications).

## Key Domain Knowledge

### The Contract-to-Close Timeline (Financed Purchase, 30-45 Days)

| Day | Milestone | Owner | Critical Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|----------------|
| 0 | Executed purchase agreement | Both agents | Clock starts. Calendar every deadline immediately. |
| 0-1 | Deliver earnest money to escrow/title | Buyer/buyer's agent | Late delivery can void the contract in some states. |
| 0-1 | Open escrow or title order | Buyer's agent or listing agent (varies) | Title search begins. |
| 1-3 | Deliver seller disclosures | Seller/listing agent | State-specific requirements. Federal lead paint disclosure if pre-1978. |
| 1-3 | Order homeowner's insurance quotes | Buyer | Lender will require binder before closing. |
| 3-5 | Order home inspection | Buyer's agent | Do not delay -- the contingency clock is ticking. |
| 7-10 | Inspection complete, report delivered | Inspector | Review immediately. |
| 7-14 | Submit inspection response / repair request | Buyer's agent | Must be within contingency period. |
| 10-14 | Inspection negotiation resolved | Both agents | Agree on repairs, credits, or as-is. |
| 7-14 | Appraisal ordered by lender | Lender | Agent cannot order; can provide comps to appraiser via lender. |
| 14-21 | Appraisal completed | Appraiser | If low, triggers renegotiation or gap coverage. |
| 14-21 | Loan conditions cleared | Lender | Buyer must respond to lender requests immediately. |
| 21-30 | Loan approval / "clear to close" | Lender | The milestone everyone waits for. Chase it weekly. |
| 25-35 | Title search completed, commitment issued | Title company | Review for exceptions, liens, encumbrances. |
| 30-38 | Closing Disclosure delivered to buyer | Lender/closing agent | TRID: minimum 3 business days before closing. |
| 35-43 | Final walkthrough | Buyer/buyer's agent | 24-48 hours before closing. Verify repairs, condition, inclusions. |
| 40-45 | Closing / settlement | All parties | Funds disburse. Keys transfer. |

**Cash deals:** Compress to 7-21 days. Remove financing and appraisal contingencies. Title and inspection remain.

### Key Contingencies and What Happens When They Expire

| Contingency | Typical Period | If Deadline Passes Without Action |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Inspection | 7-14 days | Buyer typically waives the right to request repairs or cancel based on inspection. |
| Appraisal | Tied to financing contingency | Buyer loses ability to cancel based on appraisal value. |
| Financing | 21-30 days | Buyer may be in breach if loan is not approved. Earnest money at risk. |
| Title | Usually tied to closing date | Unresolved title issues delay closing. Extension may be needed. |
| HOA review | 3-5 days | Buyer waives right to cancel based on HOA docs. |
| Due diligence (NC, etc.) | Varies (often 14-30 days) | All contingencies waive simultaneously. Earnest money becomes non-refundable. |

### TRID Compliance (Federal)

- **Loan Estimate:** Lender must provide within 3 business days of receiving a loan application.
- **Closing Disclosure:** Must be delivered to borrower at least 3 business days before closing. If the CD changes materially (APR increase >0.125%, loan product change, or prepayment penalty added), a new 3-day waiting period starts.
- **Practical impact:** Last-minute changes to loan terms can push closing by 3+ business days. Coordinate with the lender to avoid CD re-disclosure triggers.

### Wire Fraud Prevention Protocols

Wire fraud costs the real estate industry $150M+ annually. Every closing involves a wire transfer, making every transaction a potential target.

1. **Never send or accept wiring instructions by email alone.** Always verify by phone using a number you independently looked up -- not one from the email.
2. **Warn clients in writing at the start of every transaction:** include a wire fraud warning in your first communication and again before closing.
3. **If instructions change, assume fraud until proven otherwise.** Call the title company or attorney directly to verify.
4. **Cross-reference `cybersecurity-wire-fraud` for the complete prevention protocol, client warning templates, and incident response procedures.**

### Common Closing Delays and Solutions

| Delay Cause | Frequency | Resolution |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Lender processing / underwriting | Most common | Contact lender directly 2x/week minimum. Ensure buyer responds to conditions within 24 hours. |
| Appraisal issues (low value, delayed scheduling) | Common | Provide comps to lender for rebuttal. Negotiate price reduction or gap coverage. |
| Title issues (liens, boundary disputes, probate) | Moderate | Title curative work by title company. Seller may need to resolve liens pre-closing. |
| Repair completion delays | Moderate | Get repair agreements in writing with specific completion dates. Verify at walkthrough. |
| Missing documents (insurance binder, HOA letter) | Common | Maintain a checklist and follow up 7-10 days before closing on every outstanding item. |
| Survey issues | Less common | Required in some states. Order early. Resolve boundary or encroachment issues with seller. |
| HOA or condo association delays | Moderate | Order estoppel/status letter early. HOA response times vary from 3-30 days. |

### Record Retention Requirements

Most states require brokerages to retain transaction files for **3-7 years** (varies by state). The IRS recommends 7 years for tax-related documents. Best practice: retain all files for a minimum of 7 years. Electronic storage is accepted in all states under ESIGN Act and UETA.

### Industry Standards & References

- **TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule):** CFPB rule governing Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure delivery timelines. Applies to all residential mortgage transactions.
- **ALTA (American Land Title Association):** Sets standards for title insurance, settlement statements, and closing procedures. The ALTA Settlement Statement is the most widely used closing document format.
- **ESIGN Act / UETA:** Federal and state laws authorizing electronic signatures on real estate documents. Broadly accepted, but some jurisdictions require wet signatures on deeds, powers of attorney, or notarized documents.
- **State Real Estate Commissions:** Govern required forms, disclosure timelines, and closing procedures. Always use the current state-approved forms.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Tactical and checklist-driven. They are managing every transaction themselves. Give them the exact steps, in order, with deadlines. Do not assume they have a TC or support staff. When they ask "what do I do next," give them the next 3 actions with specific timeframes.

**To team leaders:** Systems-focused. They need repeatable processes their team can follow consistently. Emphasize checklists, accountability tracking, and delegation frameworks. Help them build the system, not just manage one transaction.

**To broker/owners:** Compliance and risk-oriented. They are liable for every transaction in their brokerage. Focus on audit-readiness, record retention, disclosure compliance, and identifying transactions that need broker oversight. Speak in terms of risk mitigation and liability reduction.

**To new agents:** Step-by-step and patient. Their first contract-to-close is overwhelming. Walk them through each milestone as if they have never done it before, because they have not. Normalize asking their broker questions. Emphasize that speed matters -- do not sit on deadlines.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: First-Time Agent Managing Contract to Close

**User says:** "I just got my first deal under contract. What do I do now? I've never managed a closing before."

**Actions:**
1. Congratulate them and immediately shift to action: the clock started the moment the contract was executed.
2. Provide the Day 0 action list: deliver earnest money, open escrow/title, send executed contract to lender (if buyer side) or confirm with buyer's agent that these steps are happening (if listing side).
3. Walk through the full timeline with their specific closing date, calculating backward from closing to set every contingency deadline.
4. Direct them to `references/transaction-checklist.md` and recommend they print it or load it into their project management system.
5. Identify the 4 critical items they must personally track: inspection contingency deadline, appraisal completion, financing contingency deadline, and Closing Disclosure delivery timing.
6. Recommend they set up a weekly check-in cadence with the lender (buyer side) or buyer's agent (listing side), and provide milestone updates to their client at minimum weekly. Cross-reference `client-communication` for update templates.

### Scenario 2: Closing Delayed Due to Lender Issues

**User says:** "We're supposed to close in 5 days and the lender still hasn't issued clear to close. What do I do?"

**Actions:**
1. Assess the situation: has the lender communicated the specific conditions still outstanding? If not, the buyer's agent must call the lender's processor directly today -- not email, call.
2. Common causes of last-minute lender delays: outstanding borrower conditions (pay stubs, bank statements, letter of explanation), employment re-verification, underwriting backlog, or Closing Disclosure preparation.
3. Action plan: (a) buyer's agent calls lender today for specific status and estimated timeline, (b) buyer responds to any outstanding conditions within 24 hours, (c) if clear to close is more than 2-3 days away, draft an extension addendum now rather than waiting until the day before closing.
4. Coordinate with title/closing agent to discuss rescheduling options. Notify the seller/listing agent immediately -- surprises at the last minute damage trust and can tank deals.
5. Coach on managing the client: explain that lender delays are the most common cause of closing delays (not the agent's fault) but that you are actively managing the situation and will provide daily updates until resolved.

### Scenario 3: Title Issue Discovered Before Closing

**User says:** "Title came back showing an old lien from a contractor. The seller says they paid it off years ago. Closing is in two weeks."

**Actions:**
1. This is a title curative issue and is resolvable in most cases. Two weeks is usually sufficient if action starts immediately.
2. The seller needs to provide proof of payment (cancelled check, receipt, final invoice marked paid) to the title company. The title company will then work with the lienholder to obtain a lien release.
3. If proof of payment exists, the timeline is typically 3-10 business days for the title company to clear it. If no proof exists, the seller may need to pay the lien again and then seek reimbursement from the contractor.
4. Do not wait -- the listing agent should notify the seller today and begin gathering documentation. The title company's title officer is the point of contact for resolution steps.
5. If resolution will take longer than the closing date allows, prepare an extension addendum. This is a seller-side issue, so the buyer is typically receptive to a reasonable extension, but keep them informed.
6. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for disclosure obligations: if a material title issue is discovered, all parties must be notified.

### Scenario 4: Buyer Wants to Extend the Inspection Contingency

**User says:** "The inspection found some issues and my buyer wants more time to get a specialist to look at the foundation. The inspection contingency expires in 2 days."

**Actions:**
1. Time is critical. Draft a request for extension of the inspection contingency immediately -- do not wait until the deadline.
2. The request should specify: the additional time needed (typically 5-7 days for a structural engineer), the specific reason (foundation concern identified in general inspection), and that all other contract terms remain unchanged.
3. Submit the extension request to the listing agent with a brief explanation. Most sellers will grant a reasonable extension for a legitimate concern -- stonewalling risks the buyer invoking the contingency and canceling.
4. Simultaneously, schedule the specialist inspection today if possible. Do not wait for the extension to be signed before booking.
5. Remind the buyer's agent: if the extension is denied and the contingency deadline passes, the buyer loses the right to cancel based on inspection findings. They must decide before the deadline expires whether to invoke the contingency (cancel), waive it (proceed as-is), or request the extension and hope for approval.
6. Cross-reference `estimate-analyzer` for interpreting the foundation findings and assessing severity.

### Scenario 5: Final Walkthrough Reveals Issues

**User says:** "We did the final walkthrough yesterday and the seller left a bunch of stuff in the garage and one of the agreed-upon repairs wasn't done. Closing is tomorrow."

**Actions:**
1. This is a common pre-closing issue and does not necessarily require delaying closing, but it must be addressed in writing before the closing table.
2. Options: (a) negotiate a closing credit for the unfinished repair and trash removal costs, documented in an addendum signed before closing; (b) require the seller to complete the repair and removal before closing, which means delaying; (c) withhold a portion of seller's proceeds in escrow until the work is completed (requires agreement from both parties and the closing agent).
3. The most practical path for a one-day timeline is a closing credit. Estimate the cost of the unfinished repair (get a quick contractor estimate or use reasonable figures) and the cost of junk removal ($300-$800 depending on volume). Present the credit request to the listing agent immediately.
4. Document everything: take photos during the walkthrough showing the items left and the incomplete repair. This is your evidence if there is a dispute.
5. Remind the agent: never close without addressing walkthrough issues. Once the buyer signs closing documents and funds disburse, leverage disappears. Handle it before the closing table, not after.

## Important Caveats

- **State-specific procedures vary dramatically.** Closing procedures, required documents, contingency structures, and even who conducts the closing differ by state. Always reference `references/state-closing-procedures.md` and verify with local practice. Attorney states, title company states, and escrow states operate differently.
- **This skill does not provide legal advice.** Contract interpretation, deadline disputes, and earnest money conflicts are legal matters. When a transaction involves a potential breach, disputed deadlines, or threatened litigation, the agent must involve their broker and recommend the client consult an attorney.
- **The purchase agreement is the governing document.** General timelines and checklists are starting frameworks. The specific deadlines, contingencies, and obligations in the executed contract always override general guidance.
- **Wire fraud is a real and present danger.** Every closing involves fund transfers. Cross-reference `cybersecurity-wire-fraud` for prevention protocols. Never treat wire instructions casually.
- **Lender timelines are estimates, not guarantees.** "Clear to close in 30 days" is aspirational. Build 5-7 days of buffer into every closing timeline. Coordinate with the lender directly and frequently.
- **Record retention requirements vary by state.** The safe standard is 7 years for all transaction documents. Verify your state's specific requirement through `compliance-navigator`.
