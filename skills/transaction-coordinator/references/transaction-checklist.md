## 1. How to Use This Checklist

This is a master checklist for a standard financed residential purchase. Day counts are measured from contract execution (Day 0) and assume a 40-45 day closing. Adjust all dates to match your specific contract deadlines -- the purchase agreement governs, not this checklist.

**Column key:**
- **Task:** What needs to happen
- **Owner:** B = Buyer's Agent, L = Listing Agent, BUY = Buyer, SEL = Seller, LEN = Lender, TIT = Title/Escrow, INS = Inspector, APP = Appraiser
- **Deadline:** General timeline reference (contract dates override)
- **Notes:** State variations, tips, and warnings

Mark each item complete with the date completed. Flag any item that is overdue or blocked.

## 9. Cash Transaction Modifications

Cash purchases eliminate financing-related items. Key differences:

|---------------|-------------------|
| Loan application and processing | Not applicable -- remove items 4, 18, 39-52, 59-60, 73 |
| Appraisal contingency | Buyer may still order appraisal for due diligence but no lender requirement |
| Closing Disclosure (TRID) | Not required -- no lender involved. Buyer receives a settlement statement. |
| Homeowner's insurance binder | Still recommended but not lender-mandated |
| Timeline | Can close in 7-21 days. Compress all deadlines accordingly. |
| Proof of funds | Buyer must provide proof of funds (bank/brokerage statement) in lieu of pre-approval letter. Verify within 24 hours of contract. |

**Cash closing checklist focuses on:** earnest money, title, inspection, and closing logistics. Significantly simpler but still requires disciplined deadline tracking.

---

## 10. New Construction Modifications

New construction transactions have unique requirements:

| Standard Item | New Construction Modification |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Home inspection | Conduct at pre-drywall stage AND at final walkthrough. Two inspections standard. |
| Appraisal timing | Often ordered later (when construction is substantially complete). May appraise from plans. |
| Closing timeline | Can be 60-180+ days depending on build stage. Track builder's estimated completion separately. |
| Seller disclosures | Builder provides warranty information and specification sheets in lieu of standard seller disclosure. |
| Walkthrough | Formal "punch list" walkthrough to identify construction defects before closing. Builder must address all items. |
| Builder addenda | Builders use their own contracts and addenda that heavily favor the builder. Review carefully with buyer. |
| Lender coordination | Rate lock timing is critical on long builds. Discuss lock options with lender early. |
| Upgrades and change orders | Document every change in writing. Verify all upgrades are reflected in final specs and price. |
