## 2. Closing Type Overview: Attorney vs. Title vs. Escrow

| Closing Type | How It Works | States |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Attorney State** | An attorney must be present at or supervise the closing. The attorney reviews documents, conducts the closing, and ensures legal compliance. | NY, MA, CT, DE, GA (customary), SC, WV, parts of IL and PA |
| **Title Company State** | A title company or closing agent conducts the closing. No attorney required, though either party can choose to have one. | TX, FL, AZ, OH, NC, most Midwest and Southeast states |
| **Escrow State** | An escrow officer (neutral third party) holds funds and documents. Buyer and seller typically sign separately. No formal "closing table" gathering. | CA, WA, OR, HI, NV |
| **Hybrid** | Some states allow a combination or vary by county/custom. | IL (attorney in Cook County, title company downstate), PA (varies by region) |

**Practical impact:** In attorney states, closing costs are higher (attorney fees $500-$2,500+), but the buyer and seller have legal review built into the process. In escrow states, the parties may never be in the same room. In title company states, the closing is straightforward but legal review is optional and extra.

---

## 3. California

**Closing Type:** Escrow

**Who Conducts Closing:** Licensed escrow officer at an independent escrow company or title company. Buyer and seller typically sign separately (not at the same table). Attorney involvement is optional and uncommon for standard transactions.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS):** Seller must complete this comprehensive property disclosure. One of the most detailed in the country.
- **Natural Hazard Disclosure (NHD):** Third-party report required disclosing earthquake fault zones, flood zones, fire hazard zones, and other environmental risks. Typically ordered from a disclosure company ($50-$150).
- **Preliminary Title Report:** Issued by title company. Buyer reviews for exceptions, easements, and encumbrances.
- **California Residential Purchase Agreement (RPA):** Standard form from California Association of Realtors (C.A.R.). Updated periodically -- always use the current version.
- **Buyer's Investigation Contingency:** California's version of the due diligence period. Default is 17 days per the C.A.R. RPA. Buyer can cancel for any reason during this period.
- **Good Faith Deposit:** Typically 1-3% of purchase price. Delivered within 3 business days of acceptance per the standard form.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- County transfer tax: $1.10 per $1,000 of sale price (most counties)
- City transfer tax: varies ($0-$45 per $1,000 in cities like San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Los Angeles)
- Recording fees: $15-$100+ depending on document and county
- Who pays: varies by local custom (typically split or seller pays transfer tax, buyer pays recording)

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days for financed purchases, 14-21 days for cash. Escrow can be extended by mutual agreement.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Escrow process:** Funds are held by the escrow company. Neither party has access until all conditions are met and both sides have signed. Closing occurs when the deed is recorded at the county recorder's office.
- **Community property state:** Both spouses must sign documents even if only one is on title.
- **Earthquake retrofitting:** Some cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley) require seismic retrofitting or compliance before sale.
- **Local ordinances:** Many cities have point-of-sale requirements (smoke detectors, water heater strapping, low-flow toilets, energy compliance).
- **Wire fraud risk is high** in California due to high transaction values. Verify all wire instructions by phone.

---

## 4. Texas

**Closing Type:** Title Company

**Who Conducts Closing:** Title company closing officer. Attorneys are not required but either party may hire one. The Texas Department of Insurance regulates title companies and sets title insurance rates (no negotiation on title premium -- it is the same at every company).

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **TREC (Texas Real Estate Commission) Forms:** Texas uses promulgated forms -- agents MUST use the TREC-approved contract forms. Modifying the standard forms without an attorney is unauthorized practice of law.
- **Seller's Disclosure Notice:** Required. Seller must disclose known material defects. Exemptions exist for foreclosures, estates, and certain other situations.
- **Option Period:** Unique to Texas. Buyer pays a non-refundable option fee ($100-$500+ negotiable) for the right to terminate the contract for any reason during the option period (typically 7-14 days). This functions as the due diligence/inspection period.
- **Earnest Money:** Delivered within specified timeframe per contract. Held by title company.
- **Survey Required:** Buyers almost always obtain a survey (or accept an existing survey with a T-47 affidavit from the seller). Lenders typically require it.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- **No state transfer tax in Texas.** This is a significant savings compared to most states.
- Recording fees: approximately $15-$50 per document
- Title insurance rates: set by the state; identical at every title company

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days standard. The option period drives early activity. Title companies are generally efficient.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Option period is distinct from inspection contingency.** The option fee gives the buyer an unrestricted right to terminate. It is not contingent on inspection findings -- the buyer can cancel for any reason (or no reason) during the option period.
- **Promulgated forms:** Agents who modify TREC forms or add custom clauses without an attorney face disciplinary action. Use the approved addenda.
- **Home warranty:** Very common in Texas. Often negotiated as part of the contract (seller-paid or buyer-paid).
- **No income tax:** Relevant for relocation buyers comparing states.
- **Property tax:** Among the highest in the nation (1.6-2.5%+ effective rate). Proration at closing is significant.

## 5. Florida

**Closing Type:** Title Company (most of the state) or Attorney (some areas, customary in South Florida)

**Who Conducts Closing:** Title company closing agent or attorney depending on local custom. In South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach), attorneys are more commonly used. In Central and North Florida, title companies are standard.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **Florida Realtors/Florida Bar Contract (FR/Bar):** Standard residential contract form. Updated annually.
- **Seller Property Disclosure:** Florida has limited disclosure requirements compared to other states. The principle of "caveat emptor" (buyer beware) is stronger in Florida, but the "Johnson v. Davis" standard requires sellers to disclose known material defects that are not readily observable.
- **Closing Cost Responsibility:** In Florida, who pays for title insurance and closing costs varies by county custom. In some counties, the seller pays for the owner's title policy; in others, the buyer pays. Always check local custom.
- **Estoppel Letter (HOA/Condo):** Required if the property is in an association. The association has 15 business days to respond but can charge a fee. Order immediately upon contract execution.
- **Wind Insurance (Citizens, private carriers):** In coastal areas, wind/hurricane insurance can be expensive and difficult to obtain. Buyers should begin insurance shopping on Day 1.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- Documentary stamp tax (deed): $0.70 per $100 of sale price (except Miami-Dade: $0.60 per $100)
- Documentary stamp tax (mortgage): $0.35 per $100 of loan amount
- Intangible tax on new mortgages: $0.20 per $100 of loan amount
- Recording fees: approximately $10 per page
- Who pays: varies by county custom

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days financed, 14-21 days cash. Florida closings are generally straightforward.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Flood insurance:** Many Florida properties are in FEMA flood zones. Check flood zone status immediately. Flood insurance can add $1,000-$10,000+ annually and can be a deal-breaker.
- **Wind mitigation inspection:** A separate inspection that documents wind-resistant features for insurance discount purposes. Common and recommended.
- **Homestead exemption:** Florida's homestead property tax exemption ($50,000) and creditor protection are significant. Buyers should file for homestead exemption promptly after closing.
- **Condo association approval:** Many Florida condos require buyer approval by the association. Can add 1-4 weeks. Start early.
- **Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA):** Florida has a high volume of international transactions. If the seller is a foreign person, FIRPTA withholding (15% of sale price) applies unless an exemption is met.

## 6. New York

**Closing Type:** Attorney State

**Who Conducts Closing:** Attorneys represent both buyer and seller. An attorney review period (typically 3-5 business days) follows contract signing, during which either attorney can modify or cancel the contract. The closing is conducted by the buyer's attorney, seller's attorney, and title company representative, often at the buyer's attorney's office or title company.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **Attorney Review Period:** 3-5 business days after contract signing during which attorneys can negotiate terms, request modifications, or cancel the deal. The contract is not fully binding until attorney review is complete.
- **Contract of Sale:** Typically prepared by the seller's attorney. More detailed than standard forms used in other states.
- **Property Condition Disclosure Act (PCDA):** Seller is required to provide a property condition disclosure statement OR pay a $500 credit to the buyer in lieu of disclosure. Many sellers opt for the $500 credit.
- **Transfer Tax:** Sellers pay state and local transfer taxes. In NYC, additional mansion tax for properties over $1M (graduated scale up to 3.9% for ultra-luxury).
- **Title Insurance:** Buyer typically selects the title company. Simultaneous issue policies (owner's + lender's) provide savings.
- **Managing Agent Requirement (Co-ops/Condos):** NYC co-ops require board approval for buyers (full financial review, interview). Can add 30-90+ days to the process.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- NYS transfer tax: $2 per $500 of sale price (0.4%). Additional 0.25% for residential property over $3M.
- NYC Real Property Transfer Tax: 1.0% (up to $500K) or 1.425% (over $500K) -- paid by seller
- NYC Mansion Tax (buyer): 1.0% for $1M-$2M, graduated up to 3.9% for $25M+
- Mortgage recording tax (buyer, NYC): 1.8% of mortgage amount (up to $500K mortgage) or 1.925% (over $500K)
- Recording fees: $50-$200+ per document
- Who pays: seller typically pays transfer tax; buyer pays mortgage recording tax and mansion tax

**Typical Timeline:** 60-90 days for financed purchases (longer than most states). Co-ops can take 90-120+ days. Cash deals: 30-45 days.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **The longest closing timeline of any major state.** Attorney review, title search in older urban areas, co-op board approval, and lender processing all contribute to extended timelines.
- **NYC co-ops are not real property.** Buyers purchase shares in a corporation, not real estate. This changes financing (co-op loans, not mortgages), title insurance (not always available), and closing procedures.
- **Downstate vs. upstate:** NYC, Westchester, Long Island closings are attorney-heavy and complex. Upstate closings are more similar to other states.
- **Flip tax:** Some co-ops and condos impose a flip tax (1-3% of sale price) on the seller. Check before listing.
- **Rent stabilization/regulation:** In NYC, disclosure of rent-regulated units is required for multi-family properties.

---

## 7. Pennsylvania

**Closing Type:** Hybrid (attorney customary in Philadelphia and eastern PA; title company common in western PA)

**Who Conducts Closing:** Varies by region. In the Philadelphia area and eastern PA, attorneys are customary for both buyer and seller. In western PA (Pittsburgh), title companies often handle closings. Settlement agents can be attorneys, title companies, or licensed settlement agents.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **Pennsylvania Association of Realtors (PAR) Standard Forms:** Standard agreement of sale and related forms.
- **Seller's Property Disclosure Statement:** Required by law (RESDCLA -- Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law). Comprehensive form covering all property systems and conditions.
- **Radon Disclosure:** Pennsylvania requires radon disclosure. Radon testing is very common and recommended in virtually all transactions.
- **Zoning and Use Certification:** Buyers may request a municipal zoning/use certificate to verify permitted use.
- **Transfer Tax:** Split equally between buyer and seller by default, though negotiable.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- State transfer tax: 1.0% of sale price
- Local transfer tax: varies by municipality (0.5%-2.0%). In Philadelphia: 3.278% total (city + state).
- Total transfer tax: typically 2.0% statewide (1% state + 1% local), split buyer/seller. Philadelphia is a major outlier at 4.278%.
- Recording fees: approximately $100-$300 per transaction
- Who pays: transfer tax is typically split 50/50 (buyer and seller each pay 1% in most areas)

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days standard. Philadelphia metro may trend toward 45-60 days due to attorney involvement.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Radon is a big deal in Pennsylvania.** Elevated radon levels are common throughout the state. Radon testing is standard practice and mitigation systems ($800-$1,500) are frequently part of the negotiation.
- **Dual transfer tax split:** The 50/50 split is customary but negotiable. In competitive markets, buyers may agree to pay the full transfer tax.
- **Philadelphia wage tax impact:** Philadelphia's wage tax (3.75%+ for residents) affects buyer affordability calculations for city properties.
- **Underground storage tanks:** Common in older homes. Environmental liability is a concern. Disclosure and testing are standard.
- **Escrow for taxes:** PA has separate school and municipal tax bills. Proration at closing can be complex.

## 8. Illinois

**Closing Type:** Hybrid (attorney required in Cook County/Chicago area; title company common downstate)

**Who Conducts Closing:** In the Chicago metro area (Cook County and collar counties), attorneys are customary for both buyer and seller, and the standard contract includes an attorney review period. In central and southern Illinois, title companies commonly handle closings.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **Attorney Review Period (Chicago area):** 5 business days from contract execution. Either attorney can propose modifications or cancel. Contract is not binding until attorney review expires without disapproval.
- **Illinois Residential Real Property Disclosure Act:** Seller must complete a disclosure form covering 23 items related to property condition.
- **Radon Disclosure:** Required at the state level.
- **Transfer Declaration:** Both buyer and seller complete transfer declaration forms filed with the county recorder.
- **Multi-Board Contract (Chicago) / IAR Contract (downstate):** Different standard forms depending on the MLS/association.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- State transfer tax: $0.50 per $500 of sale price (0.1%)
- County transfer tax: $0.25 per $500 (Cook County) -- varies by county
- City of Chicago transfer tax: $5.25 per $500 (1.05%) -- one of the highest municipal transfer taxes
- Total in Chicago: approximately 1.2% of sale price
- Recording fees: $50-$200 per document
- Who pays: in Cook County, seller customarily pays the state and county tax; buyer pays the city transfer tax. Varies downstate.

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days. The 5-day attorney review can extend the effective timeline from acceptance.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Chicago vs. downstate is essentially two different markets** with different practices, forms, and customs. Clarify which area you are working in.
- **Water certification:** City of Chicago requires a water meter reading and certification before closing.
- **Zoning compliance:** City of Chicago requires a zoning certificate for some property types.
- **Real estate tax proration:** Illinois property taxes are paid in arrears (you pay last year's taxes this year). Tax proration at closing is complex -- typically prorated based on estimated current-year taxes using the prior year as a basis. Credits at closing.
- **Survey:** Customary (though not required) in many transactions. Buyer typically receives from seller or orders new.

## 9. Ohio

**Closing Type:** Title Company

**Who Conducts Closing:** Title company or title agent. Attorney involvement is optional. Ohio closings are generally straightforward and efficient.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **Ohio Division of Real Estate Forms:** Standard purchase agreement forms vary by local board/association.
- **Residential Property Disclosure Form:** Required by law (Ohio Revised Code 5302.30). Seller completes a comprehensive disclosure of property conditions.
- **Lead-Based Paint Disclosure:** Federal requirement for pre-1978 homes applies.
- **Radon Disclosure:** Not required by state law, but radon testing is common, especially in certain regions.
- **Title Insurance:** Ohio Department of Insurance regulates rates. Owner's and lender's policies are standard.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- State conveyance fee: $1.00 per $1,000 of sale price (0.1%)
- County conveyance fee: up to $3.00 per $1,000 (varies by county, typically $1.50-$3.00 per $1,000)
- Total: approximately 0.25%-0.4% of sale price
- Recording fees: $28-$34 per document (varies by county)
- Who pays: seller typically pays the conveyance fee. Recording fees may be split.

**Typical Timeline:** 30-40 days. Ohio closings are among the most efficient.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Low transfer taxes.** Ohio's combined conveyance fees are relatively low compared to other major states.
- **Property tax abatement:** Some Ohio cities offer property tax abatements for new construction or renovated properties. Buyers should inquire.
- **CAUV (Current Agricultural Use Value):** Rural properties with CAUV tax status may face recoupment charges if converted to residential use. Title company should flag.
- **Radon varies significantly by region.** Southern Ohio counties have higher radon risk. Testing is recommended even though disclosure is not required.
- **Straightforward process.** Ohio closings are relatively uncomplicated compared to attorney states or high-tax states. The title company handles most of the heavy lifting.

## 10. Georgia

**Closing Type:** Attorney State (by custom and practice)

**Who Conducts Closing:** Closing attorney. Georgia law does not technically require an attorney for residential closings, but the standard practice is for a closing attorney to conduct the closing, prepare the deed, and handle the disbursement. It is considered unauthorized practice of law for a non-attorney to prepare the deed.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **GAR (Georgia Association of Realtors) Purchase and Sale Agreement:** Standard form used statewide.
- **Seller's Property Disclosure Statement:** Georgia's Property Condition Disclosure Act requires sellers to disclose known material defects. The form covers structural, mechanical, environmental, and condition categories.
- **Due Diligence Period:** Georgia's standard GAR contract uses a due diligence period (similar to NC). During this period, the buyer can terminate for any reason. The due diligence period fee (separate from earnest money) is non-refundable and paid directly to the seller.
- **Earnest Money vs. Due Diligence Fee:** Two separate payments. The due diligence fee ($500-$5,000+ negotiable) is non-refundable and paid to the seller. Earnest money is held in escrow and is refundable if the buyer terminates during the due diligence period.
- **Closing Attorney Selection:** Buyer typically selects the closing attorney (varies by area).

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- Real estate transfer tax: $1.00 per $1,000 of sale price (0.1%)
- Intangible tax on new mortgages: $1.50 per $500 of loan amount (0.3%)
- Recording fees: approximately $5 per page + $25 per document
- Who pays: transfer tax and intangible tax customarily split by negotiation. Transfer tax is often paid by the seller; intangible tax by the buyer.

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days. The due diligence period typically runs 14-21 days.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **Due diligence fee is non-refundable from Day 1.** Unlike earnest money, the buyer loses the DD fee if they cancel for any reason. This incentivizes serious buyers. The amount is negotiable and reflects the strength of the buyer's commitment.
- **Termite/wood-destroying organism inspection:** Very common in Georgia. Often required by lender. Typically ordered early in due diligence.
- **Closing attorney conducts the closing.** The closing attorney prepares the closing disclosure, deed, and all closing documents. This adds a layer of legal review but also adds attorney fees ($400-$1,000+).
- **Septic and well inspections:** Common in rural areas. County health department may need to certify the septic system.
- **Lot/land disclosures:** Georgia has specific disclosures for properties with flood risk, wetlands, or previous agricultural use.

---

## 11. North Carolina

**Closing Type:** Attorney State (attorney must supervise or conduct closing)

**Who Conducts Closing:** Closing attorney. North Carolina requires that an attorney supervise real estate closings. The attorney prepares the deed, reviews the closing documents, and supervises the disbursement. Title insurance companies work with the closing attorney but do not independently close.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **NC Association of Realtors Standard Form 2-T (Offer to Purchase and Contract):** Standard contract form used statewide.
- **Due Diligence Period:** North Carolina's most distinctive feature. During the due diligence period (negotiated, typically 14-30 days), the buyer can terminate for any reason. The due diligence fee (separate from earnest money) is non-refundable and paid directly to the seller at execution.
- **Due Diligence Fee vs. Earnest Money:** The DD fee ($500-$5,000+ negotiable) is the buyer's cost for the right to terminate during the due diligence period. It is paid to the seller, not held in escrow, and is non-refundable. Earnest money is deposited in escrow and is refundable if the buyer terminates during the DD period.
- **Mineral and Oil/Gas Rights Disclosure:** Required for properties in certain counties.
- **Residential Property Disclosure Statement:** Required by law. Seller discloses known conditions.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- NC excise tax (revenue stamps): $1.00 per $500 of sale price (0.2%)
- Recording fees: approximately $26 for the first page, $4 per additional page
- Who pays: seller customarily pays excise tax. Recording fees for the deed paid by buyer.

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days. The due diligence period is the critical first phase.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **The due diligence period replaces individual contingencies.** Unlike most states that have separate inspection, appraisal, and financing contingencies, North Carolina's DD period functions as a single all-encompassing contingency. ALL buyer investigations (inspection, appraisal, financing, survey, insurance, etc.) should be completed within the DD period.
- **After the DD period, earnest money is at risk.** If the buyer terminates after the DD period expires, they forfeit the earnest money (unless another contractual provision applies, such as the financing contingency -- which NC does still include as a separate provision).
- **Attorney closing adds legal oversight.** Closing costs include attorney fees ($400-$800+ typically), but the buyer gets legal review of all documents.
- **Radon disclosure is not required** by state law, but radon testing is recommended, particularly in the mountain regions (western NC).
- **Flood insurance:** Eastern NC coastal properties frequently require flood insurance. Check FEMA flood maps early.

---

## 12. Arizona

**Closing Type:** Escrow (Title Company)

**Who Conducts Closing:** Title company/escrow officer. Similar to California's escrow process but typically simpler. Buyer and seller may sign at the title company (often at the same time, unlike CA). Attorney involvement is optional and uncommon for standard transactions.

**Key State-Specific Requirements:**
- **AAR (Arizona Association of Realtors) Residential Resale Real Estate Purchase Contract:** Standard form used statewide. Comprehensive contract with detailed contingency provisions.
- **Seller's Property Disclosure Statement (SPDS):** Required by custom (not statute in Arizona, but the standard AAR contract requires it). Very detailed -- 8+ pages covering all property systems, conditions, and environmental factors.
- **Affidavit of Disclosure:** Required for properties in unincorporated areas. Discloses access, utilities, and zoning information.
- **Inspection Period (BINSR):** The Buyer's Inspection Notice and Seller's Response (BINSR) form is used for inspection negotiations. The inspection period is specified in the contract (typically 10-15 days).
- **Title and Escrow:** Title companies handle escrow, title search, and closing. AZ title insurance rates are competitive.

**Transfer Tax & Recording Fees:**
- **No state transfer tax in Arizona.** Like Texas, this is a significant savings.
- Recording fees: approximately $30 for the first page, $3 per additional page
- Affidavit of Property Value: $2 filing fee (required for all transfers)
- Who pays: no transfer tax to allocate. Recording fees typically split by custom.

**Typical Timeline:** 30-40 days. Arizona closings are efficient and straightforward.

**Unique Considerations:**
- **No transfer tax** makes Arizona one of the most buyer/seller-friendly states for closing costs.
- **Termite (wood-destroying organism) inspection:** Very common in Arizona. Often required by lender. Subterranean termites are prevalent in the Phoenix metro area.
- **Pool inspection:** Common in Arizona given the high percentage of homes with pools. A separate pool inspection ($100-$200) is recommended.
- **ADEQ (Arizona Department of Environmental Quality):** Underground storage tank disclosure may be required. Check for older homes.
- **HOA prevalence:** Arizona has one of the highest percentages of homes in HOAs. HOA document review period is included in the standard contract (5 days). HOA transfer fees can be $200-$1,000+.
- **Water considerations:** Water availability and rights are important in Arizona, particularly in rural areas or newer developments. The AAR contract includes a water disclosure.
- **Solar lease/PPA:** Many Arizona homes have solar panels with leases or power purchase agreements. These must be disclosed, reviewed, and either assumed by the buyer or resolved pre-closing.

## 13. Quick Comparison Matrix

| State | Closing Type | Attorney Required? | Transfer Tax (Approx.) | Unique Feature | Typical Timeline |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **CA** | Escrow | No | 0.11%+ (varies by city) | Escrow process, NHD report, local point-of-sale | 30-45 days |
| **TX** | Title Company | No | None | Option period, promulgated forms, no transfer tax | 30-45 days |
| **FL** | Title Company / Attorney | Varies by area | 0.7%+ (doc stamps) | Wind insurance, flood zones, condo approval delays | 30-45 days |
| **NY** | Attorney | Yes | 0.4%-5%+ (varies, NYC highest) | Attorney review period, longest timelines, co-op process | 60-90+ days |
| **PA** | Hybrid | Varies by region | 2.0% (4.28% in Philly) | Radon prevalence, split transfer tax | 30-45 days |

| **GA** | Attorney (custom) | Custom | 0.1% + 0.3% intangible | Due diligence fee (non-refundable), closing attorney | 30-45 days |
| **NC** | Attorney | Yes | 0.2% | Due diligence period replaces individual contingencies | 30-45 days |
| **AZ** | Escrow/Title | No | None | No transfer tax, BINSR form, HOA prevalence, pool inspections | 30-40 days |

### Key Takeaways for Agents Working Across State Lines

1. **Always verify the closing type for the specific state AND locality.** A PA agent moving from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia faces different procedures.
2. **Transfer taxes are the largest variable in closing costs across states.** From zero (TX, AZ) to 5%+ (NYC luxury). Factor this into client net-sheet calculations.
3. **Attorney review periods (NY, IL) effectively extend the negotiation period past contract execution.** Do not assume the deal is "done" when the contract is signed.
4. **Due diligence states (NC, GA) operate fundamentally differently from contingency states.** Understand the difference before advising clients.
5. **Flood insurance, wind insurance, and environmental hazards vary dramatically by state.** Identify insurance risks early -- they can kill deals.
6. **Use state-approved or customary forms.** Using the wrong form or modifying a promulgated form can create legal liability.
