# Fair Housing Compliance

The compliance skill that sits behind every word an agent writes, every property they show, and every client interaction they have. The Fair Housing Act (1968, amended 1988) prohibits discrimination in housing based on seven federal protected classes -- and most states add more. Violations are not hypothetical: HUD processed over 7,500 complaints in a recent year, fair housing organizations run undercover testing operations in every major market, and a single substantiated complaint can result in six-figure fines, license revocation, and career-ending civil liability. This skill helps agents, team leaders, and broker/owners recognize discriminatory practices (including the subtle ones they do not realize are discriminatory), write compliant advertising and marketing content, handle accommodation requests properly, and build daily habits that protect both their clients' rights and their own licenses. For listing content generation, cross-reference `listing-launch-engine`. For broader regulatory compliance, cross-reference `compliance-navigator`.

## Core Principles

1. **Describe the property, never the person.** Every listing description, social media post, showing conversation, and marketing piece must describe the home's features, condition, and location attributes -- never the type of person who should or does live there. If a word or phrase references who might occupy the home rather than what the home offers, remove it. No exceptions.
2. **Intent is irrelevant; impact is everything.** Fair housing violations do not require discriminatory intent. An agent who steers buyers away from a neighborhood "for their own comfort" has violated the law regardless of motive. An ad that says "great for young professionals" discriminates on familial status and age whether or not the agent meant to exclude families. The legal standard is whether a reasonable person would perceive the language or action as indicating a preference, limitation, or discrimination.
3. **When the answer varies by state, say so -- and say nothing more.** Many states and municipalities add protected classes beyond the federal seven (source of income, marital status, age, veteran status, gender identity, criminal history, and others). Never assume the federal list is complete for any user. Always flag that state and local law may expand protections, and direct the user to verify with their state real estate commission.

## Instructions

### How to Respond to Fair Housing Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Protected Classes & General Fair Housing Law

Includes: what are the protected classes, does fair housing apply to my situation, what is the Fair Housing Act, who is covered, exemptions, what happens if I violate fair housing law, penalties, HUD complaints, testing.

**Workflow:**
1. State the seven federal protected classes: Race, Color, Religion, National Origin, Sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity per HUD's February 2021 interpretation under Bostock), Disability, and Familial Status (families with children under 18, pregnant women, anyone securing custody of a minor).
2. Identify whether the user's state adds additional protected classes. Common additions include: source of income (CA, OR, WA, DC, and others), marital status (over 20 states), age (NY, NJ, and others), veteran/military status (NY, CA, IL, and others), gender identity/expression (codified in 20+ states beyond the federal interpretation), ancestry, citizenship status, and criminal history (some municipalities). If the user's state is unknown, list common additions and advise them to check their state's fair housing law.
3. Explain who is covered: virtually all residential real estate transactions. The Fair Housing Act applies to sales, rentals, lending, insurance, and advertising. Narrow exemptions exist (owner-occupied buildings with 4 or fewer units, single-family homes sold by owner without a broker, religious organizations for non-commercial housing) -- but these exemptions do NOT apply to advertising. Discriminatory advertising is prohibited even for exempt properties.
4. Describe the complaint and enforcement process: HUD complaint (filed within 1 year of violation), HUD investigation, conciliation or administrative hearing, federal court. Penalties: first offense up to $21,039, second offense within 5 years up to $52,596, third offense within 7 years up to $105,194. State penalties often exceed federal. Plus civil liability, license suspension/revocation, and reputational damage.
5. Explain fair housing testing: organizations such as the National Fair Housing Alliance deploy trained testers who pose as homebuyers or renters to detect discriminatory treatment. Tests compare how agents treat individuals of different protected classes. Agents are tested without notice and the results are admissible as evidence.

#### Category B: Advertising & Marketing Compliance

Includes: listing descriptions, marketing materials, social media posts, what words can I use, is this phrase okay, MLS descriptions, fair housing in advertising, discriminatory language, property descriptions.

**Workflow:**
1. Apply the core rule: describe the property, not the person. Review the specific language in question against the Prohibited Terms and Acceptable Alternatives lists in Key Domain Knowledge below.
2. If the user is asking about a specific word or phrase, provide a clear yes/no with explanation. Do not hedge. If a phrase could reasonably be perceived as indicating a preference based on a protected class, it should not be used.
3. For listing description reviews: scan for demographic descriptors (age, family composition, religion, national origin, disability references), neighborhood composition references, proximity to religious institutions used as a selling point, and any language describing the ideal occupant.
4. Provide compliant alternatives that are equally compelling. The goal is not to make descriptions bland -- it is to make them descriptive of the property. "Spacious 4-bedroom with fenced backyard and finished playroom" is better marketing than "perfect for families" AND it is compliant.
5. Remind the user that ALL marketing is covered: MLS descriptions, social media posts (including Stories and Reels), email campaigns, direct mail, yard signs, open house flyers, video scripts, personal website copy, and digital advertising (including Facebook ad targeting). Cross-reference `listing-launch-engine` for compliant content generation.
6. Note that the Equal Housing Opportunity logo or statement should appear on all advertising materials. Many MLSs and brokerages require it.

#### Category C: Steering, Blockbusting & Discriminatory Practices

Includes: is this steering, showing properties only in certain neighborhoods, directing clients based on race or demographics, blockbusting, redlining, different treatment, different terms, refusal to show.

**Workflow:**
1. Define the practice in question:
   - **Steering:** Directing or influencing a buyer's choice of neighborhood based on their protected class (or the protected class composition of the neighborhood). Includes showing only certain neighborhoods, emphasizing or discouraging certain areas, or making comments about neighborhood demographics.
   - **Blockbusting:** Inducing property owners to sell by representing that persons of a particular protected class are moving into the neighborhood. Historically used to exploit racial fears for profit.
   - **Redlining:** Denying services or varying terms based on the racial or ethnic composition of a neighborhood. Though primarily a lending practice, agents can participate through differential service levels by geography.
2. Help the user evaluate their situation against the legal standard. Steering does not require overt statements. Showing a minority buyer only listings in minority-majority neighborhoods, even if those neighborhoods match the buyer's stated criteria, can constitute steering if comparable properties in other areas were not presented.
3. Provide the safe practice: present all listings that match the buyer's stated criteria (price, size, features, commute, school ratings) regardless of neighborhood demographics. Let the buyer choose. Never volunteer information about neighborhood racial, ethnic, or religious composition. If asked directly, redirect: "I can't characterize the neighborhood's demographics, but I can share census data and community resources so you can research that yourself."
4. If the user describes a scenario that is or may be a violation, state clearly that it is a violation (or a risk), explain why, and recommend they consult their broker immediately.

#### Category D: Disability Accommodations & Familial Status

Includes: reasonable accommodation, reasonable modification, service animals, emotional support animals, accessibility, disability discrimination, familial status, can I ask about children, occupancy limits, housing for older persons.

**Workflow:**
1. For disability accommodation questions: explain the difference between reasonable accommodation (a change in rules, policies, or services -- typically at the housing provider's expense) and reasonable modification (a physical change to the property -- typically at the requester's expense for existing housing, at the provider's expense for new construction). Agents cannot ask about the nature or severity of a disability. They can request documentation that the person has a disability-related need for the accommodation if it is not obvious.
2. For service animal and emotional support animal questions: under fair housing law (distinct from ADA), both service animals and emotional support animals must be permitted in housing with no-pet policies. No pet deposits or fees may be charged. The provider may request documentation from a healthcare provider for emotional support animals but may not ask about the specific disability. Breed and weight restrictions cannot be applied to assistance animals.
3. For familial status questions: it is illegal to refuse to sell, rent, or show housing based on the presence of children. Agents cannot ask "Do you have children?" as a qualifying question. Occupancy standards may be applied if they are reasonable (HUD guideline: 2 persons per bedroom as a reasonable standard, but this is not a rigid rule -- total square footage, room sizes, and local codes are factors). The only exception is "housing for older persons" qualifying under the 55+ exemption (at least 80% of units occupied by at least one person 55+, published policies and procedures, age verification).
4. For questions about occupancy and familial status: agents and landlords can set reasonable, non-discriminatory occupancy limits but cannot use occupancy limits as a pretext for familial status discrimination. A maximum of 2 per bedroom for a 1-bedroom apartment is reasonable. A maximum of 2 people in a 4-bedroom house is not.

#### Category E: Implicit Bias & Fair Housing Best Practices

Includes: implicit bias, unconscious discrimination, how to avoid fair housing violations, fair housing training, best practices, self-audit, fair housing culture.

**Workflow:**
1. Define implicit bias in the real estate context: unconscious preferences or associations that affect an agent's behavior toward clients of different protected classes. Manifests as: spending more time with certain clients, providing more detailed information to some buyers, showing higher-quality properties to some clients, differing communication speed or warmth, and steering masked as "helpfulness."
2. Provide the self-audit framework: Are you showing the same quality and quantity of properties to all buyers at a given price point? Are you providing the same level of service and communication to all clients? Are you making assumptions about what neighborhoods a client would "be comfortable in"? Are you using the same qualifying questions for all clients? If any answer differs by client demographic, there is a bias problem.
3. Recommend concrete practices: use standardized buyer needs questionnaires for every client, present all properties meeting stated criteria regardless of neighborhood demographics, document your property selection process, track your service metrics across client demographics, and complete implicit bias training annually.
4. For broker/owners: recommend implementing fair housing audits (mystery shopping your own agents), standardized intake processes, regular training beyond the CE minimum, and a written fair housing policy that includes social media and advertising guidelines.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Federal Protected Classes (7)

| Class | What It Covers | Common Violations |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Race** | All racial groups | Differential treatment in showings, steering to/from neighborhoods |
| **Color** | Skin color (distinct from race) | Often overlaps with race discrimination |
| **Religion** | All religious practices and beliefs, including non-belief | Marketing referencing proximity to houses of worship as a selling point, scheduling showings around religious observances |
| **National Origin** | Country of birth, ancestry, language, cultural characteristics | Language requirements, assumptions about documentation status, name-based discrimination |
| **Sex** | Gender, sexual orientation, gender identity (per Bostock/HUD 2021) | Different qualifying questions, sexual harassment, LGBTQ+ discrimination |
| **Disability** | Physical and mental disabilities, history of disability, perceived disability | Refusing accommodation requests, asking about the nature of a disability, failing to permit modifications |
| **Familial Status** | Families with children under 18, pregnant women, those securing custody | Steering families away from certain properties, occupancy restrictions as pretext, "adult-only" marketing |

### Common State-Added Protected Classes

Source of income (Section 8 vouchers, disability income) -- CA, OR, WA, DC, CT, MA, NJ, and others. Marital status -- over 20 states. Age -- NY, NJ, CT, and others. Veteran/military status -- NY, CA, IL, and others. Gender identity/expression -- codified in 20+ states. Ancestry -- PA, OH, and others. Citizenship status -- select jurisdictions. Criminal history -- select municipalities (ban-the-box for housing). Domestic violence victim status -- NY, WA, and others.

Always advise users to verify their state and local protected classes. Municipal ordinances can add protections beyond state law.

### Prohibited Terms in Advertising

**Terms that indicate preference based on protected class -- do NOT use:**

| Prohibited Term/Phrase | Why It Violates | Compliant Alternative |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| "Perfect for families" / "family-friendly" | Familial status preference | "4 bedrooms, fenced backyard, near parks" |
| "Great for young professionals" | Age and familial status | "Updated finishes, walkable to dining and transit" |
| "Ideal for empty nesters" / "retirees" | Age and familial status | "Single-level living, low-maintenance lot" |
| "Great for couples" | Familial status, marital status | "Cozy 2-bedroom with open floor plan" |
| "Christian/Jewish/Muslim neighborhood" | Religion | Do not reference neighborhood religious composition |
| "Near [church/temple/mosque]" as selling point | Religion | "Convenient to community amenities" |
| "Quiet neighborhood" | Can imply no children (familial status) | "Tree-lined street" or "established neighborhood" |
| "Safe neighborhood" / "low crime" | Can be proxy for racial composition | Do not characterize neighborhood safety. Let buyers research crime data independently |
| "Exclusive" / "prestigious" / "private community" | Can imply exclusion based on protected class | "Gated community" (if factual) or describe actual amenities |
| "Walking distance to [specific school]" | Can be proxy for neighborhood demographics | Provide school district information factually if asked; do not use as marketing language |
| "Master bedroom" | Racial connotation (many MLSs have changed) | "Primary bedroom" or "owner's suite" |
| "No children" / "adults only" | Familial status (unless qualifying 55+ community) | Do not use. If 55+ community, state the legal exemption factually |
| "English speakers only" | National origin | Do not use |
| "No Section 8" / "No vouchers" | Source of income (in states where protected) | Verify state law. In protected states, cannot refuse based on payment source |
| "Man cave" / "mother-in-law suite" | Sex, familial status connotations | "Bonus room," "guest suite," "accessory dwelling" |
| "Bachelor pad" | Sex, familial status, marital status | "Efficient 1-bedroom" or "studio with city views" |

**General rule:** If a term references a type of person rather than a feature of the property, it is likely non-compliant.

### Compliant Advertising Best Practices

1. Describe rooms, features, finishes, dimensions, and condition -- never occupants.
2. Describe location by proximity to factual landmarks (parks, transit, highways, downtown) -- not demographic characteristics.
3. Use the Equal Housing Opportunity logo or statement on all marketing.
4. If describing a 55+ community, state the legal basis factually ("Age-qualified community under the Housing for Older Persons Act").
5. Review all listing descriptions, social posts, and marketing materials before publishing. Cross-reference `listing-launch-engine` for content that is built compliant from the start.
6. Audit Facebook and Google ad targeting -- do not target or exclude based on protected classes. Facebook's Special Ad Category for housing restricts targeting options for this reason.
7. Photographs and virtual tours should show the property, not people. If lifestyle images are used in branding, ensure diversity.

### Steering Prevention Framework

**The Standard:** Present all properties meeting the buyer's stated objective criteria. Never filter by neighborhood demographics.

**What constitutes steering (even unintentionally):**
- Showing a minority buyer only properties in minority-majority neighborhoods
- Telling any buyer "you'd love this neighborhood -- it's very [demographic descriptor]"
- Discouraging a buyer from a neighborhood by commenting on its demographics
- Emphasizing school demographics rather than school performance data
- Showing fewer properties or lower-quality properties to certain clients
- Driving different routes to properties based on client demographics
- Providing more neighborhood information to some buyers than others

**Safe practices:**
- Use a standardized property search form with every buyer
- Present all properties matching the criteria -- let the buyer narrow
- If asked about neighborhood demographics, respond: "I am not able to characterize the demographics of a neighborhood, but I can direct you to census data and community resources where you can research that on your own."
- Document your search criteria and the properties presented for each client
- If a buyer requests a specific neighborhood demographic, explain that you cannot select or exclude properties on that basis, but they are welcome to research neighborhoods independently

### Reasonable Accommodation Quick Reference

| Request Type | Who Pays | Documentation Required |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| Service animal in no-pet housing | No cost to requester, no pet deposit | None for obvious physical disability. May request documentation for non-obvious disability. Cannot ask about specific disability. |
| Emotional support animal | No cost to requester, no pet deposit | Letter from healthcare provider confirming disability-related need. Cannot ask about specific disability. |
| Reserved accessible parking | Provider (rental) | Documentation of disability-related need |
| Grab bars, ramp, wider doorways | Requester (existing housing). Provider (new construction post-1991) | Documentation of disability-related need |
| Policy exception (e.g., allowing early move-in for disability-related reason) | Case-by-case | Documentation of disability-related need |

### Industry Standards & References

- **Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619):** The federal law. Covers sales, rentals, lending, insurance, and advertising.
- **HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development):** Enforcement agency. Receives and investigates complaints. Publishes guidance on evolving interpretations.
- **Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) + HUD Interpretation (2021):** Extended sex discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity under fair housing law.
- **National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA):** The leading fair housing organization. Conducts testing, publishes annual fair housing trends reports, and advocates for enforcement.
- **Housing for Older Persons Act (HOPA, 1995):** Establishes the 55+ community exemption from familial status protections. Requires: at least 80% of units have one occupant 55+, published policies, and age verification procedures.
- **State Real Estate Commissions:** Administer additional protected classes and state-specific fair housing requirements. The primary licensing authority with enforcement power.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Direct and practical. They need to know which words to use and which to avoid, how to handle uncomfortable client requests (like "show me a neighborhood without..."), and what to do if they realize they have made a mistake. Give them the rule, the reason, and the compliant alternative in that order. Do not lecture -- they know fair housing exists. Give them the actionable specifics they are missing.

**To team leaders:** Systems-oriented. They need to ensure every agent on their team produces compliant marketing, conducts showings without steering, and handles accommodation requests properly. Focus on standardized processes: compliant listing description templates, showing checklists, intake questionnaires, and regular audits. Recommend they review all listing descriptions before MLS entry.

**To broker/owners:** Liability-focused and operational. They bear vicarious liability for every agent's fair housing violation. Focus on: written fair housing policies, advertising review procedures, complaint response protocols, annual training requirements, testing awareness, and documentation systems that demonstrate a culture of compliance. Recommend mystery shopping their own agents annually.

**To new agents:** Patient, specific, and scenario-based. New agents absorb fair housing rules best through examples, not abstractions. Lead with "here is what NOT to say" examples, then provide the compliant alternatives. Emphasize that fair housing violations do not require bad intentions -- most violations come from agents who had no idea they were discriminating. Normalize checking language before publishing.

---

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Agent Asks Whether a Listing Description Phrase Is Compliant

**User says:** "Can I describe a listing as being in a 'quiet, family-friendly neighborhood close to St. Mary's Church'?"

**Actions:**
1. Flag three issues: "quiet" can imply no children (familial status); "family-friendly" directly references familial status; "close to St. Mary's Church" references a religious institution as a selling point (religion).
2. Explain: each phrase could be perceived as indicating a preference based on a protected class. The intent does not matter -- the legal standard is whether a reasonable person would interpret the language as signaling a preference.
3. Provide compliant alternatives: "Established neighborhood on a tree-lined street. Convenient to parks, schools, and community amenities. 4-bedroom colonial with fenced backyard and finished basement." This describes the same property and location compellingly without referencing protected classes.
4. Remind the agent that every listing description is advertising under fair housing law -- MLS entries, social media posts, flyers, and website copy all must comply. Cross-reference `listing-launch-engine` for generating compliant content from the start.

### Scenario 2: Buyer Asks Agent to Show Properties Only in Certain Demographics

**User says:** "My buyer told me they only want to see homes in neighborhoods that are predominantly [specific demographic]. What do I do?"

**Actions:**
1. State the rule: agents cannot select or exclude properties based on the demographic composition of a neighborhood. Honoring this request would constitute steering, which violates the Fair Housing Act regardless of whether the client initiated it.
2. Provide the response script: "I understand you have preferences about where you live, and I respect that. However, I am not able to select or filter properties based on neighborhood demographics -- that would violate fair housing law. What I can do is search based on your criteria for the home itself: price, size, features, commute time, school ratings, and proximity to amenities. You're welcome to research neighborhood demographics on your own through census data and community resources."
3. Document the conversation in writing (email follow-up summarizing what was discussed and the criteria you will use for the search).
4. If the buyer insists, explain that you cannot comply and that any agent who does is violating the law. If the buyer terminates the relationship over this, that is an acceptable outcome -- it is far better than a fair housing complaint.
5. Cross-reference `listing-services` for proper showing protocols and `compliance-navigator` for documentation standards.

### Scenario 3: Landlord Client Asks About Rejecting a Tenant with a Service Animal

**User says:** "My landlord client has a no-pets policy. A tenant applicant has an emotional support animal. Can we reject them?"

**Actions:**
1. State the rule: under the Fair Housing Act, emotional support animals are not pets. A landlord must provide a reasonable accommodation to allow an emotional support animal in a no-pet property. This applies to virtually all housing (not just federally funded).
2. Explain what the landlord CAN request: a letter from a licensed healthcare provider confirming that the applicant has a disability and that the animal provides disability-related support. The landlord cannot ask about the nature of the disability, require specific medical records, or demand that the animal be certified or registered.
3. Explain what the landlord CANNOT do: charge a pet deposit or pet fee for an assistance animal, impose breed or weight restrictions on an assistance animal, or deny housing based on the presence of the animal (assuming valid documentation is provided).
4. Advise: if the landlord proceeds with denial, they face a fair housing complaint, potential damages, and the agent may face personal liability and license action for facilitating the violation. Recommend the landlord consult a real estate attorney before taking any adverse action.
5. Note the distinction between fair housing law (which covers housing) and the ADA (which covers public accommodations). Fair housing protections for assistance animals are broader than ADA protections.

### Scenario 4: Broker Wants to Audit Marketing Materials for Fair Housing Compliance

**User says:** "I want to review my brokerage's listing descriptions and social media for fair housing compliance. What should I look for?"

**Actions:**
1. Provide the advertising audit checklist:
   - Scan all listing descriptions for prohibited terms (reference the Prohibited Terms table above).
   - Check whether descriptions focus on property features or occupant characteristics.
   - Review neighborhood descriptions for demographic proxies ("safe," "quiet," "exclusive," "diverse," "up-and-coming").
   - Verify that the Equal Housing Opportunity logo or statement appears on all marketing.
   - Review social media profiles for brokerage identification and fair housing compliance.
   - Audit Facebook and Google ad campaigns for targeting exclusions based on protected classes.
   - Check that photography and video do not suggest occupant preference (all-white models in lifestyle photos, for example).
   - Review all template emails, drip campaigns, and automated communications for discriminatory language.
2. Recommend establishing a pre-publication review process: all listing descriptions reviewed by a designated compliance officer or broker before MLS entry.
3. Suggest annual fair housing training for all agents that goes beyond the state CE minimum -- focus on advertising compliance and implicit bias, not just the basics.
4. Recommend periodic testing: hire a fair housing organization or consultant to conduct paired testing of your agents.
5. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for broader compliance audit procedures and `listing-launch-engine` for building compliant-by-default content generation into the workflow.

### Scenario 5: Agent Questions Whether "Primary Bedroom" Is Really Necessary

**User says:** "Do I really have to say 'primary bedroom' instead of 'master bedroom'? Isn't this overkill?"

**Actions:**
1. Explain the context: many MLSs, state associations, and brokerages have adopted "primary bedroom" (or "owner's suite") as the standard term, replacing "master bedroom." The change reflects awareness that "master" carries historical connotations related to slavery and has been identified by fair housing advocates as exclusionary language.
2. Clarify the legal status: using "master bedroom" is not currently a standalone fair housing violation in most jurisdictions. However, many MLSs have formally changed their fields and style guides. Using the old term may violate MLS rules, brokerage policy, or both.
3. Provide the practical recommendation: use "primary bedroom" or "owner's suite." It costs nothing to make the change, it eliminates any risk, and it signals professionalism and awareness to clients and colleagues. In a profession where perception of bias can trigger complaints and investigations, the safest course is always the one that removes ambiguity.
4. If the user pushes back, note that fair housing compliance is about cumulative culture, not individual terms. An agent who resists a low-cost language change signals to clients, colleagues, and testers that they may resist more substantive compliance requirements as well.

## Important Caveats

- **State and local law almost always expands protections beyond the federal seven.** Never assume the federal protected classes are the complete list. Always advise users to verify with their state real estate commission and local municipality. Some cities (e.g., New York City, San Francisco, Seattle) have significantly broader protections than their state.
- **This skill does not provide legal advice.** Fair housing law intersects with constitutional law, civil rights law, disability law, and state administrative law. For specific legal questions, complaints, or potential violations, agents should consult their broker first and then a fair housing attorney.
- **Fair housing testing is real and active.** The National Fair Housing Alliance and local fair housing organizations conduct thousands of tests annually. Agents should operate under the assumption that any interaction could be a test. This is not paranoia -- it is professionalism.
- **Advertising rules apply to all platforms, including personal social media.** An agent's personal Instagram post promoting a listing is advertising under fair housing law. Stories, Reels, TikToks, and tweets that reference properties or real estate services must comply.
- **The "I didn't mean it that way" defense does not exist in fair housing law.** The legal standard is whether a reasonable person would perceive the language or action as discriminatory. Intent is not required for a violation.
- **Reasonable accommodation law is evolving rapidly.** Guidance on emotional support animals, in particular, is subject to ongoing regulatory and judicial interpretation. Advise users to consult current HUD guidance and state law for the latest requirements.
- **This skill does NOT replace fair housing training.** It supplements it. Agents should complete formal fair housing training annually -- not just the CE minimum, but substantive training on implicit bias, advertising compliance, and evolving case law.
