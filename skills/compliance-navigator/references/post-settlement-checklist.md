## Background

On March 15, 2024, the National Association of REALTORS (NAR) agreed to a $418 million settlement resolving the Sitzer-Burnett and related antitrust lawsuits challenging the traditional commission structure. The practice changes took effect **August 17, 2024** and are binding on all MLSs affiliated with NAR (covering the vast majority of MLSs nationwide).

The settlement fundamentally changed how buyer agent compensation is communicated and agreed upon. The core principle: buyers and their agents must negotiate and agree on compensation directly, rather than relying on offers of compensation communicated through the MLS.

The DOJ did not sign off on the settlement and retains authority to pursue additional changes. Some state legislatures and real estate commissions have enacted additional requirements beyond the federal settlement terms.

## Buyer Agency Agreement Requirements

Every agent must have a written buyer agency agreement in place before providing representation services. This is the single biggest operational change from the settlement.

### What the Agreement Must Include

- [ ] **Objectively ascertainable compensation.** The agreement must specify the buyer agent's compensation in concrete terms. Acceptable formats:
  - A specific dollar amount (e.g., "$8,000")
  - A specific percentage of the purchase price (e.g., "2.5%")
  - An hourly rate (e.g., "$150/hour")
  - A flat fee for defined services
  - NOT acceptable: "whatever the seller offers," "to be determined," "market rate," or any open-ended/vague formulation

- [ ] **Defined duration.** The agreement must have a clear start and end date. Open-ended agreements with no termination date are non-compliant. Best practices:
  - Short initial terms for new relationships (30-90 days)
  - Property-specific agreements for limited engagements
  - Renewable terms with written consent

- [ ] **Defined scope.** The agreement should specify the geographic area, property type, or specific properties covered. An agreement covering "any property anywhere" is technically compliant but may face scrutiny.

- [ ] **Negotiability disclosure.** The agreement must conspicuously state that broker fees and commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable. This language must be prominent -- not buried in fine print.

- [ ] **Cannot authorize the agent to receive compensation exceeding the agreed-upon amount.** If the agreement specifies 2.5% and the seller offers 3%, the agent cannot pocket the difference without renegotiating with the buyer.

### When the Agreement Must Be Signed

- **Before touring any property.** This includes private showings, new construction model visits, and attending open houses with a buyer (if acting as their agent).
- **Before any property search activity.** Setting up MLS searches, previewing properties, or conducting market research on the buyer's behalf all constitute services that require the agreement.
- **Open house exception:** A buyer attending an open house on their own (without their agent) does not need a buyer agency agreement with the listing agent. However, if the listing agent wants to convert that buyer into a client, the agreement must be signed before any further representation services.

### Practical Implementation

- Keep blank agreements in your car, phone (digital), and office at all times.
- Use a short consultation meeting to explain the agreement before the first showing.
- Offer different agreement structures (property-specific, short-term, geographic area) to reduce buyer resistance.
- Frame the agreement as buyer protection: "This defines exactly what I owe you, what it costs, and how long it lasts."
- Practice explaining the agreement until it feels natural. Awkward delivery kills buyer confidence.

## MLS Changes

The settlement eliminated the MLS as a mechanism for communicating offers of buyer agent compensation.

### What Changed

- [ ] **No buyer agent compensation fields on the MLS.** The fields where listing agents previously entered the buyer agent commission percentage or amount have been removed from all NAR-affiliated MLSs.
- [ ] **No offers of compensation in MLS data feeds.** Compensation information cannot be transmitted through IDX, VOW, or syndication feeds.
- [ ] **No compensation in MLS remarks.** Agents cannot use the public or agent remarks fields to communicate offers of buyer agent compensation.
- [ ] **No workarounds through MLS tools.** Using showing platforms, MLS messaging, or other MLS-connected tools to broadcast compensation offers is non-compliant.

### What the MLS Still Does

- Lists properties for sale with property details, photos, and showing instructions
- Communicates listing terms (price, included items, seller concessions available)
- Provides market data and comparable sales
- Facilitates cooperation between brokerages in the transaction

---

## Disclosure Requirements on All Agreements

### Buyer Agency Agreements

- [ ] Negotiability disclosure: "Broker/agent fees and commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable."
- [ ] This language must be **conspicuous** -- bold, larger font, separate paragraph, or otherwise clearly visible.
- [ ] Must appear on every buyer agency agreement without exception.

### Listing Agreements

- [ ] Negotiability disclosure on listing agreements: same requirement as buyer agreements.
- [ ] Disclosure that the listing broker will not share compensation with a cooperating broker through the MLS.
- [ ] If the seller chooses to offer buyer agent compensation: document it in the listing agreement or a separate addendum, specifying the amount and the method of communication (through listing agent, on the property, in advertising, etc.).

### All Brokerage Agreements

- [ ] Clear explanation of the services the agent will provide.
- [ ] The specific compensation the agent will receive.
- [ ] How the compensation will be paid (by the client directly, from seller proceeds, through seller concessions, or a combination).
- [ ] The duration and termination provisions of the agreement.

---

## Compensation Negotiation Rules

### Permitted Practices

- [ ] Buyer and buyer's agent negotiate compensation directly and memorialize it in the buyer agency agreement.
- [ ] Seller may offer compensation to the buyer's agent, but the offer must be communicated **outside the MLS** (see "What Sellers CAN Still Do" below).
- [ ] Buyer's agent may request that the seller pay the buyer agent's compensation as part of the offer.
- [ ] Buyer's agent compensation can be structured as a seller concession in the purchase agreement.
- [ ] The buyer may adjust their offer price to account for compensation they are paying their agent.
- [ ] Compensation amounts can differ from one transaction to the next. There is no requirement for uniformity.

### Prohibited Practices

- [ ] Communicating offers of buyer agent compensation through the MLS (fields, remarks, data feeds, connected platforms).
- [ ] Representing that a particular compensation rate is "standard," "customary," "typical," or "the going rate."
- [ ] Conditioning access to listings on the compensation offered.
- [ ] Steering buyers toward or away from listings based on compensation.
- [ ] Requiring buyers to agree to compensation that exceeds what the buyer's agent actually earns from all sources.

---

## What Sellers CAN Still Do

Sellers retain significant flexibility in how they structure compensation. The settlement changed the **communication mechanism** (off MLS), not the seller's right to offer compensation.

- [ ] **Offer buyer agent compensation.** Sellers can still choose to offer compensation to attract buyer agents and, by extension, buyers. This remains a marketing strategy.
- [ ] **Communicate the offer through the listing agent.** The listing agent can inform buyer agents (individually, by phone, email, or agent-to-agent communication) that the seller is offering compensation. This just cannot happen through MLS fields or data.
- [ ] **Advertise the offer on the property.** Sellers can include compensation offers in property-specific marketing (flyers, property websites, signage) -- just not on the MLS.
- [ ] **Structure compensation as a seller concession.** The offer can be included in the purchase agreement as a closing cost credit directed to the buyer to pay their agent.
- [ ] **Offer different amounts to different buyer agents.** There is no requirement for uniformity, provided the variation is not based on protected characteristics.
- [ ] **Choose not to offer any buyer agent compensation.** The seller has no obligation to pay the buyer's agent. The buyer and buyer's agent handle their own compensation arrangement.

---

## What Agents CANNOT Do

These are the bright-line prohibitions from the settlement and related regulatory guidance.

### Buyer Agents CANNOT:

- [ ] Tour properties with a buyer without a written buyer agency agreement in place.
- [ ] Use open-ended compensation language ("whatever the seller offers") in buyer agreements.
- [ ] Retain compensation that exceeds the amount agreed upon in the buyer agreement without renegotiating with the buyer.
- [ ] Steer buyers toward listings offering higher compensation or away from listings offering lower (or no) compensation.
- [ ] Represent their compensation as "standard" or "non-negotiable."
- [ ] Refuse to show a listing because the seller is not offering buyer agent compensation.

### Listing Agents CANNOT:

- [ ] Enter buyer agent compensation in MLS fields, remarks, or any MLS-connected communication channel.
- [ ] Condition listing services on the seller offering a specific buyer agent compensation amount.
- [ ] Use MLS tools, showing services, or syndication feeds to communicate compensation offers.
- [ ] Represent to the seller that a specific buyer agent compensation rate is "required" or "standard."

### All Agents CANNOT:

- [ ] Discuss or agree on commission rates with agents at competing brokerages (antitrust).
- [ ] Suggest that any commission rate is "standard," "typical," or "the going rate" in the market.
- [ ] Condition cooperation, showing access, or offer presentation on compensation.
- [ ] Filter or sort listings based on compensation offered when working with buyers.

## Common Violations and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Touring Without a Buyer Agreement
**The violation:** Showing properties to a buyer before executing a written buyer agency agreement.
**How it happens:** Buyer calls from a sign or website, wants to see a house "right now." Agent meets them at the property without paperwork.
**How to avoid:** Always have digital agreements accessible on your phone or tablet. Build the consultation meeting into your process. Use a property-specific agreement for urgent situations.

### 2. Vague Compensation Terms
**The violation:** Using language like "up to 3%" or "to be determined" or "as offered by seller" in the buyer agreement.
**How it happens:** Agent is uncomfortable naming a specific number. Tries to leave it flexible.
**How to avoid:** Pick a number. Practice saying it. "My fee is 2.5% of the purchase price" is compliant. "Whatever we can get" is not. The number can differ by client or property -- it just must be specific.

### 3. Compensation in MLS Remarks
**The violation:** Including buyer agent compensation in MLS agent remarks (e.g., "2.5% offered to buyer's agent" or "generous co-op").
**How it happens:** Listing agent wants to attract buyer agents and defaults to the old method.
**How to avoid:** Communicate compensation offers through direct agent-to-agent contact, property-specific marketing, or seller concession provisions in the listing -- never through MLS fields or remarks.

### 4. Missing Negotiability Disclosure
**The violation:** Executing a buyer or listing agreement without the required negotiability statement.
**How it happens:** Using an old form or a form from a non-NAR source that lacks the required language.
**How to avoid:** Use only current state/association-approved forms. Verify the disclosure is present before every execution. If using custom forms (where permitted), include the disclosure prominently.

### 5. Steering Based on Compensation
**The violation:** Showing or recommending properties based on the compensation offered rather than the buyer's needs.
**How it happens:** Agent checks compensation before deciding which properties to show. Skips properties with no or low compensation offers.
**How to avoid:** Present all properties that meet the buyer's criteria regardless of compensation. If no compensation is offered, discuss with the buyer how their agent fee will be covered before showing.

### 6. Antitrust-Risky Commission Discussions
**The violation:** Discussing or comparing commission rates with agents at competing brokerages.
**How it happens:** Casual conversation at a broker open, office meeting, or industry event. "What are you charging buyers now?"
**How to avoid:** Never discuss your specific rate with agents at other brokerages. Safe response: "Our fees are set independently and are negotiable with each client."

### 7. Retaining Excess Compensation
**The violation:** Buyer agreement specifies 2.5%, seller offers 3%, agent keeps the full 3% without buyer consent.
**How it happens:** Agent does not track the difference between agreed compensation and compensation received from other sources.
**How to avoid:** If compensation from all sources exceeds the buyer agreement amount, disclose the overage to the buyer and either reduce the buyer's obligation or renegotiate the agreement. Document the resolution.

### 8. Using Pre-Settlement Forms
**The violation:** Using buyer agreements, listing agreements, or offer forms that predate the August 2024 settlement.
**How it happens:** Old forms saved on computer, printed stock not updated, or agent is unaware of new versions.
**How to avoid:** Purge all pre-settlement forms from digital and physical storage. Use only forms downloaded after August 2024 from your state or local association. Check form revision dates before use.
