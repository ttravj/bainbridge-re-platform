# Compliance Navigator

The "am I doing this right?" skill. Navigates the regulatory landscape that governs every real estate transaction -- agency law, disclosures, contracts, antitrust, RESPA, NAR Code of Ethics, MLS rules, advertising compliance, and the post-NAR settlement requirements that rewrote the rulebook in August 2024. Compliance is not optional, and it is not simple. A single violation can trigger license suspension, fines, lawsuits, or E&O claims. This skill helps agents, team leaders, and broker/owners operate within the rules while still running a profitable business.

## Core Principles

1. **When in doubt, disclose.** The legal standard in most states favors disclosure. Agents who disclose too much face no penalty. Agents who disclose too little face lawsuits, license actions, and E&O claims. If a fact could influence a buyer's or seller's decision, disclose it.
2. **Compliance is state-specific until proven otherwise.** Federal law sets the floor, but state law governs most day-to-day practice. Agency types, disclosure forms, advertising rules, and CE requirements vary dramatically by state. Never assume that what works in one state is legal in another.
3. **The contract is the authority.** When a compliance question involves a specific transaction, the answer almost always starts in the contract. Read the applicable purchase agreement, listing agreement, or buyer agency agreement before giving guidance. General rules yield to specific contractual terms.

### How to Respond to Compliance & Regulatory Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Agency Law & Fiduciary Duties

Includes: fiduciary duties, types of agency, dual agency, transaction broker, designated agency, who do I represent, can I represent both sides, what are my obligations.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the user's state -- agency law varies significantly. Reference `references/state-compliance-matrix.md` for state-specific agency types permitted.
2. Explain the six fiduciary duties (loyalty, obedience, disclosure, confidentiality, accountability, reasonable care) and how they apply to the specific question.
3. Clarify the agency type in play: buyer's agent, seller's agent, dual agent (where permitted), transaction broker, or designated agent. Define the obligations and limitations of each.
4. If dual agency is the question, provide the state-specific answer (legal in some states like CA and NY with consent, prohibited in others like FL which uses transaction broker instead).
5. Emphasize that agency relationships must be disclosed in writing -- timing and form vary by state.
6. Cross-reference `fair-housing-compliance` if the question touches on steering or discriminatory representation concerns.

#### Category B: Disclosure Requirements

Includes: what do I need to disclose, seller disclosure, material defects, lead paint, agency disclosure, environmental hazards, HOA, death on property, sex offenders, stigmatized properties, TRID.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the disclosure type (property condition, agency relationship, environmental, financial, or settlement-related).
2. Clarify the applicable requirement -- federal (lead paint for pre-1978 homes, TRID for lender disclosures) or state (seller property disclosures, agency disclosures).
3. Provide the timing requirement: when must the disclosure be made and in what form.
4. For property condition disclosures, explain the agent's obligation versus the seller's. In most states, agents must disclose known material defects even if the seller does not -- but agents are not required to inspect.
5. Flag state-specific variations: some states require disclosure of deaths on the property, some do not. Stigmatized property rules vary widely. Reference `references/state-compliance-matrix.md`.
6. Cross-reference `transaction-coordinator` for TRID timeline requirements (Loan Estimate within 3 business days, Closing Disclosure 3 business days before closing).

#### Category C: Post-NAR Settlement Compliance

Includes: settlement rules, buyer agency agreement requirements, MLS changes, can I still offer compensation, what changed, am I compliant, new forms, settlement compliance.

**Workflow:**
1. Provide the current rule from `references/post-settlement-checklist.md` with specificity.
2. Explain the practical impact on the user's workflow -- what they must do differently and when.
3. Walk through the buyer agency agreement requirements: mandatory before touring, objectively ascertainable compensation, defined duration, negotiability disclosure.
4. Clarify what sellers CAN still do (offer compensation off-MLS, through listing agents, as seller concessions) and what agents CANNOT do (communicate offers of compensation through MLS, tour without agreements, use open-ended compensation terms).
5. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for fee conversation guidance and compensation structuring.

#### Category D: Antitrust & RESPA

Includes: price-fixing, discussing rates with other agents, referral fees, RESPA, kickbacks, affiliated business arrangements, can I pay for referrals, group boycotts, market allocation.

**Workflow:**
1. For antitrust questions: provide clear guardrails. Never discuss, agree on, or coordinate commission rates with competing agents or brokerages. Never suggest a "standard" rate. Never refuse to show properties based on compensation offered. These are federal violations carrying criminal penalties.
2. For RESPA questions: explain what is and is not permitted. Referral fees between licensed agents/brokerages are generally permitted. Referral fees to unlicensed parties are prohibited. Kickbacks between settlement service providers (lender, title, inspector) are illegal.
3. For affiliated business arrangements: the arrangement is legal if properly disclosed using the Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure form AND the consumer is not required to use the affiliated provider.
4. Emphasize the post-settlement heightened scrutiny on all commission and referral practices. The DOJ did not sign off on the NAR settlement and retains authority to pursue further action.
5. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for antitrust-safe language in commission discussions.

#### Category E: Advertising, MLS Rules & Record Retention

Includes: advertising rules, brokerage name requirements, team advertising, social media compliance, MLS rules, Clear Cooperation, status reporting, record retention, how long to keep files.

**Workflow:**
1. For advertising: the universal rule is that the brokerage name must appear in all advertising (print, digital, social media, signage). Team names cannot appear more prominently than the brokerage name in most states. Social media profiles must include brokerage identification.
2. For MLS rules: address the specific rule in question. Clear Cooperation requires that a listing be submitted to the MLS within one business day of being marketed to the public. Status changes must be reported promptly. Data use is governed by MLS licensing agreements.
3. For record retention: most states require 3-7 years. Provide the state-specific requirement from `references/state-compliance-matrix.md`. Recommend retaining files for the longer of the state requirement or 7 years (statute of limitations for many claims).
4. Flag that social media advertising is the #1 area where agents unknowingly violate rules -- personal posts that promote listings without brokerage identification, testimonials without proper framing, and team branding that obscures the brokerage.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Agency Law Fundamentals

**Six Fiduciary Duties (OLD CAR):**
- **O**bedience: Follow lawful instructions from your client
- **L**oyalty: Put your client's interests above your own and all others
- **D**isclosure: Reveal all material facts that could affect the client's decisions
- **C**onfidentiality: Protect your client's private information (survives the transaction)
- **A**ccountability: Account for all funds and documents entrusted to you
- **R**easonable Care: Exercise the skill and care expected of a competent professional

**Agency Types by State:**
- **Single agency (buyer's or seller's agent):** Full fiduciary duties to one party. Available in all states.
- **Dual agency:** Representing both buyer and seller in the same transaction. Legal in some states with written consent (CA, NY, IL, OH, PA, AZ). Prohibited or restricted in others (FL, CO, KS, OK, TX).
- **Transaction broker:** Facilitates the transaction without representing either party. No fiduciary duty of loyalty or confidentiality. Used in FL, CO, and others as the default or alternative to dual agency.
- **Designated agency:** Broker designates one agent to represent the buyer and another to represent the seller within the same brokerage. Allowed in many states as an alternative to dual agency.

### Disclosure Requirements

**Federal (apply everywhere):**
- **Lead-Based Paint Disclosure:** Required for all homes built before 1978. Seller must disclose known lead paint hazards, provide EPA pamphlet, and allow 10-day testing period. Penalties up to $19,507 per violation.
- **TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure):** Loan Estimate within 3 business days of application. Closing Disclosure 3 business days before closing. Delays if material changes occur.

**State (varies):**
- Seller property condition disclosure: required in most states but form, scope, and timing vary. Some states (TX, CA, NY) have detailed multi-page forms. Others (AL, WY) rely on caveat emptor with limited disclosure duties.
- Agency disclosure: timing varies from first substantive contact (CA), to before showing (NY), to before offer (others).
- Death on property: some states require disclosure (CA -- deaths within 3 years), others specifically exempt it.
- Sex offender registries: most states say agents are not required to disclose proximity. Some states actively prohibit it as it could violate fair housing laws.

### Antitrust Essentials

Three categories of antitrust violations that endanger agents:

1. **Price-fixing:** Any discussion, agreement, or coordination of commission rates between competing brokerages or agents. Includes casual conversations at open houses, broker meetings, or industry events. The language trap: saying "the standard rate" or "the going rate" implies price coordination.
2. **Market allocation:** Agreements between competitors to divide markets geographically, by property type, or by customer type.
3. **Group boycotts:** Agreements among competitors to refuse to work with certain companies, agents, or business models (e.g., refusing to show listings from discount brokerages).

Penalties: Sherman Act violations carry up to $100M in corporate fines, $1M in individual fines, and 10 years imprisonment. Treble damages in civil suits.

### RESPA Key Rules

- **Section 8(a):** Prohibits giving or receiving anything of value for referrals of settlement services. This means: no paying title companies for leads, no accepting gifts from lenders for sending them clients, no splitting fees with unlicensed referral sources.
- **Section 8(b):** Prohibits fee-splitting except for services actually performed.
- **Section 8(c) Exceptions:** Cooperative brokerage commissions (agent-to-agent referral fees) are permitted. Employer payments to employees are permitted. Affiliated business arrangements are permitted if properly disclosed and the consumer is not required to use the affiliate.

### NAR Code of Ethics -- Key Articles

| Article | Requirement | Common Violations |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Protect and promote client interests; honest dealing with all parties | Failure to present all offers |
| 2 | No exaggeration, misrepresentation, or concealment of material facts | Overstating square footage, hiding defects |
| 3 | Cooperate with other brokers when it serves the client | Refusing to show competing listings |
| 9 | Written agreements for all services rendered | Verbal-only commission agreements |
| 12 | Honest, truthful advertising; present true picture | Misleading photos, phantom listings |
| 16 | Do not interfere with another REALTOR's exclusive relationships | Soliciting listed or represented clients |

### Practice of Law Boundaries

Agents may:
- Fill in blanks on pre-approved, brokerage- or association-provided forms
- Explain the general purpose of contract provisions
- Recommend that clients consult an attorney

Agents may NOT:
- Draft contracts or contract clauses from scratch
- Interpret specific legal provisions or advise on legal rights
- Provide opinions on title issues, tax implications, or legal disputes
- Modify pre-approved forms beyond completing blank fields

Unauthorized practice of law is a criminal offense in every state and a common source of E&O claims.

### Industry Standards & References

- **NAR Settlement Terms (2024):** Binding practice changes effective August 17, 2024 on all NAR-member MLSs. Full terms at nar.realtor.
- **DOJ Antitrust Division:** Ongoing oversight of real estate commission practices. Did not sign off on the NAR settlement.
- **State Real Estate Commissions:** The primary regulatory authority for agent licensing, conduct, and enforcement. Each state has its own commission or department.
- **RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2601-2617):** Federal law governing settlement service providers. Enforced by CFPB.
- **Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619):** Federal anti-discrimination law. See `fair-housing-compliance` for full guidance.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Clear and directive. They need to know what to do, what not to do, and the specific consequence of getting it wrong. Use concrete examples, not abstract legal principles. When an action creates risk, say so plainly.

**To team leaders:** Systematic. They need to ensure compliance across multiple agents with varying experience levels. Focus on creating compliant systems, training checklists, and audit procedures that catch problems before they become violations.

**To broker/owners:** Liability-focused. They bear vicarious liability for their agents' compliance failures. Emphasize supervisory obligations, risk mitigation, record retention, and the specific areas where brokerage-level compliance programs are required (advertising review, file audits, trust account management, post-settlement procedures).

**To new agents:** Patient and precise. Compliance is overwhelming for new agents. Break requirements into categories they can learn incrementally. Prioritize the highest-risk areas first (agency disclosure, buyer agreements, fiduciary duties, advertising rules) and build from there. Normalize asking their broker before acting in uncertain situations.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Agent Unsure About Dual Agency Obligations

**User says:** "I have a listing, and an unrepresented buyer wants to make an offer. Can I represent both of them?"

**Actions:**
1. Identify the user's state to determine whether dual agency is permitted.
2. If permitted (e.g., CA, NY, OH): explain that dual agency requires written, informed consent from both buyer and seller BEFORE the dual representation begins. The agent owes limited fiduciary duties to both parties -- they cannot advocate for one side on price or terms, cannot disclose one party's negotiating position to the other, and must treat both fairly.
3. If not permitted (e.g., FL): explain that the agent cannot represent both parties. Options include: operating as a transaction broker (facilitating without representing either party), referring the buyer to another agent, or suggesting the buyer retain their own representation.
4. Regardless of state: warn that dual agency is the #1 source of E&O claims and ethics complaints. Even where legal, many experienced agents and brokers discourage it. The risk-reward calculus rarely favors dual agency.
5. Recommend the user discuss the specific situation with their broker before proceeding.

### Scenario 2: Agent Asks Whether They Need to Disclose a Known Defect

**User says:** "My seller told me the basement leaks during heavy rain but said not to mention it. What do I do?"

**Actions:**
1. State clearly: the agent has an independent duty to disclose known material defects in most states, regardless of the seller's instructions. A leaking basement is a material defect -- it affects structural integrity, habitability, and value.
2. Explain the fiduciary duty hierarchy: the duty of obedience requires following the client's lawful instructions. Concealing a known material defect is not a lawful instruction. The duty of disclosure overrides obedience here.
3. Walk through the consequences of non-disclosure: buyer discovers the defect post-closing, sues both the seller and the agent, E&O claim is filed, state licensing board investigates. Damages can include repair costs, diminished value, and punitive damages in fraud cases.
4. Recommend the agent: (a) inform the seller that the defect must be disclosed, (b) document the conversation in writing, (c) ensure the defect appears on the seller's property disclosure form, and (d) if the seller refuses to disclose, consult the broker and consider whether they can continue the representation.
5. Flag that "seller told me not to disclose" is never a defense. The agent's license is their own, and they bear independent liability.

### Scenario 3: Agent Confused About Post-Settlement Buyer Agreement Requirements

**User says:** "A buyer called me from an open house and wants me to show them another property tomorrow. Do they really need to sign a buyer agency agreement first?"

**Actions:**
1. Confirm: yes, a written buyer agency agreement must be in place before touring any property with a buyer. This has been required since August 17, 2024 for all agents whose MLS participates in the NAR settlement (which covers the vast majority of MLSs).
2. Explain the requirements: the agreement must specify the agent's compensation in objectively ascertainable terms (a dollar amount, a percentage, or an hourly rate -- not "whatever the seller offers"), have a defined duration and scope, and include the negotiability disclosure.
3. Provide practical guidance: many agents use a short-term or property-specific agreement for initial showings. This reduces buyer resistance while maintaining compliance. A 30-day agreement limited to specific properties is compliant and low-pressure.
4. Address the open house nuance: at an open house, the listing agent is representing the seller. A buyer agency agreement is not required for a buyer to attend an open house on their own. It IS required for an agent to tour the buyer to any property, including showing them an open house.
5. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for scripts on explaining the agreement to the buyer and `buyer-representation` for the consultation-first approach.

### Scenario 4: Broker Asking About Advertising Compliance for Agent Social Media

**User says:** "My agents are posting listings on Instagram without the brokerage name. How do I fix this?"

**Actions:**
1. Confirm the violation: virtually every state requires the brokerage name to appear in all advertising, including social media posts. Instagram stories, reels, posts, and bios that promote properties or services must include the brokerage identification.
2. Provide the fix: (a) require all agents to include the brokerage name in their social media bios, (b) require brokerage identification on every post that promotes a listing, service, or the agent's business, (c) create templates or overlays that include the required information.
3. Explain the enforcement: state licensing boards actively review social media. Many have issued fines and citations specifically for social media advertising violations. MLS rules may also require brokerage identification on any shared listing data.
4. Address team name rules: in most states, team names cannot appear more prominently than the brokerage name. Some states require the brokerage name and team name to appear in the same font size. Reference `references/state-compliance-matrix.md` for state-specific advertising rules.
5. Recommend: create a written social media policy, review it annually, and audit agent accounts quarterly. Document the reviews.

### Scenario 5: Agent Worried About an Antitrust Conversation at a Broker Open

**User says:** "At a broker open today, another agent asked me what I'm charging buyers now. I told them my rate. Did I just violate antitrust law?"

**Actions:**
1. Assess the risk: a single disclosure of your own rate, in itself, is not necessarily an antitrust violation. The violation occurs when there is an agreement or coordination of rates. However, these conversations create the appearance of coordination and are dangerous territory.
2. Explain what crosses the line: if the other agent says "that's what we're charging too," and you both continue at that rate, a plaintiff's attorney could argue tacit price coordination. If multiple agents at the event discuss rates and converge on similar numbers, the risk is even higher.
3. Provide the safe practice going forward: do not discuss your specific rate or fee structure with agents at competing brokerages. If asked, the safe response is: "Our fees are set independently by our brokerage and are fully negotiable with each client. I'm not comfortable discussing specifics."
4. Advise: report the conversation to their broker. The broker should document it and may want to issue a reminder to agents about antitrust guidelines.
5. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for antitrust-safe language frameworks.

## Important Caveats

- **State-specific variations govern most compliance questions.** This skill provides frameworks and general principles. The specific requirements in your state may differ significantly. Always verify with your state's real estate commission and use current state-approved forms. Reference `references/state-compliance-matrix.md` for the top 10 states.
- **This skill does not provide legal advice.** Compliance questions often intersect with contract law, antitrust law, agency law, and administrative regulation. For specific legal questions, agents should consult their broker first and, when necessary, a real estate attorney.
- **Post-settlement rules may continue to evolve.** The DOJ did not sign off on the NAR settlement and retains authority to pursue further changes. Some states have enacted additional requirements beyond the federal settlement. Monitor nar.realtor, your state association, and your MLS for updates.
- **The NAR Code of Ethics applies only to REALTOR members.** Non-member agents are governed by state law and MLS rules but are not bound by the Code of Ethics. However, state licensing law often mirrors or exceeds Code of Ethics requirements.
- **When this skill references the `fair-housing-compliance` skill, defer to that skill for detailed fair housing guidance.** Fair housing law is sufficiently complex to warrant its own dedicated skill with deeper scenarios and advertising compliance analysis.
- **Record retention requirements are minimums.** Many claims are filed years after a transaction closes. Retaining records for 7 years (the statute of limitations for many civil actions) is prudent regardless of the state minimum.
- **Practice of law boundaries are strictly enforced.** When an agent's question is really a legal question (interpreting a clause, advising on rights, resolving a title dispute), the correct answer is always: consult an attorney.
