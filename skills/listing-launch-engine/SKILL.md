# Listing Launch Engine

The one-input, all-outputs content generation skill. Give it a property's details and it produces every marketing asset an agent needs: MLS description, social media posts by platform, email campaign sequence, direct mail copy, open house promotional materials, and video walkthrough scripts. This skill does not advise on marketing strategy (that is `listing-services`). It generates the actual content -- ready to copy, paste, customize, and deploy. Every piece of output is written to be compelling, accurate, and fair-housing compliant. Serves solo agents who lack a marketing coordinator, team leaders standardizing listing launches across their roster, and new agents who stare at a blank MLS description field for 45 minutes.

## Core Principles

1. **Describe the property, never the occupant.** Every word of marketing content must describe the home's features, finishes, location, and lifestyle -- never the type of person who "should" live there. No demographic proxies. No neighborhood composition. No references to schools, houses of worship, or community demographics as selling points. Fair housing compliance is non-negotiable and embedded in every output. Cross-reference `fair-housing-compliance` for the complete framework.
2. **Specific beats superlative.** "Renovated kitchen with quartz countertops, soft-close cabinetry, and a 36-inch gas range" sells a home. "Amazing kitchen you'll love" sells nothing. Every description uses concrete details -- materials, dimensions, brand names, recent upgrades with year completed -- because specificity builds credibility and buyers search for features, not adjectives.
3. **Platform-native, not copy-pasted.** An Instagram Reel caption is not a Facebook post is not a LinkedIn article. Each platform has its own format, audience behavior, optimal length, hashtag strategy, and engagement pattern. Content generated for one platform must be written natively for that platform, not resized from a generic template.

## Instructions

### How to Respond to Listing Marketing Queries

When a user requests marketing content for a property, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Full Listing Launch Package

Includes: "market this listing," "I need all marketing for this property," "listing launch package," "create everything for my new listing."

**Workflow:**
1. Gather property details if not provided: address (or general location), beds/baths/square footage, year built, lot size, key features (garage, pool, view, acreage, waterfront), recent updates/renovations with year completed, architectural style, notable finishes or materials, neighborhood name, and list price.
2. Ask about the agent's brand voice if not previously established: professional/formal, conversational/approachable, luxury/elevated, or energetic/enthusiastic. Default to professional-conversational if not specified.
3. Generate the complete package in this order:
   - **MLS Description** (primary and extended remarks)
   - **Social Media Posts** (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn)
   - **Email Campaign** (just-listed announcement, open house invite)
   - **Direct Mail Copy** (just-listed postcard)
   - **Video Walkthrough Script** (60-90 second property tour)
4. Present each asset under a clear heading with platform-specific formatting notes (character limits, hashtag counts, image/video guidance).
5. Flag any details where the user should verify accuracy before publishing (square footage, year of renovations, HOA details, lot dimensions).
6. Remind the agent to review all content against their MLS's specific rules (character limits, prohibited terms, required fields) and local fair housing requirements.

#### Category B: MLS Description Only

Includes: "write a description for," "MLS remarks," "property description," "listing description."

**Workflow:**
1. Gather property details: beds/baths/sqft, lot size, key features, updates, architectural style, neighborhood, and list price.
2. Write two versions:
   - **Primary remarks** (250-500 characters for the MLS main field -- varies by MLS). Lead with the strongest feature. Pack specific details. End with a call to action or lifestyle statement.
   - **Extended remarks** (up to 1,000 characters). Expand on room-by-room highlights, neighborhood amenities, and property lifestyle.
3. Follow the MLS Description Framework in Key Domain Knowledge.
4. Run a mental fair-housing compliance check: no demographic language, no "ideal for" statements, no neighborhood composition references. Cross-reference `fair-housing-compliance` if any language is borderline.
5. Note any MLS-specific rules the agent should verify (some MLSs prohibit all-caps, URLs, agent contact info, or certain promotional language in remarks).

#### Category C: Social Media Content

Includes: "social media posts for my listing," "Instagram post for this property," "just listed post," "create social content," "TikTok script."

**Workflow:**
1. Gather property details and confirm which platforms the agent uses.
2. Generate platform-specific content following the Platform Formats in Key Domain Knowledge:
   - **Instagram:** Carousel caption + Reel script + Story sequence outline
   - **Facebook:** Full post with description + open house event copy
   - **TikTok:** 15-60 second video script with hook, walkthrough beats, and CTA
   - **LinkedIn:** Professional angle -- market context, investment potential, agent expertise showcase
3. Include hashtag recommendations per platform (see Hashtag Strategy below).
4. Suggest posting schedule: which day/time to post each piece for maximum reach.
5. Provide image/video direction for each post (what to photograph, which rooms to feature, vertical vs. horizontal orientation).

#### Category D: Email Campaign

Includes: "listing email blast," "email announcement," "email campaign for my listing," "open house email invite."

**Workflow:**
1. Gather property details and ask who the audience is: full database, local agents, buyer leads, SOI, or a targeted segment.
2. Generate the requested email(s) from the Email Campaign Templates in Key Domain Knowledge. Each email includes: subject line (under 50 characters), preview text (under 90 characters), body copy, call to action, and an unsubscribe/compliance note.
3. For a full campaign, generate the sequence: just-listed announcement, open house invitation, price change notification template, and under-contract/just-sold follow-up.
4. Remind the agent about CAN-SPAM compliance: physical address required, unsubscribe link required, no deceptive subject lines.

#### Category E: Video Script

Includes: "video walkthrough script," "property video," "listing video script," "neighborhood video."

**Workflow:**
1. Gather property details and confirm the video type: property walkthrough (60-90 seconds), agent-hosted tour (2-3 minutes), neighborhood spotlight (2-3 minutes), or short-form social clip (15-30 seconds).
2. Write a scripted walkthrough following the Video Script Structure in Key Domain Knowledge: hook (first 3 seconds), exterior approach, room-by-room flow, feature callouts, lifestyle close, and CTA.
3. Include camera direction notes: which angles to capture, where to pause, suggested B-roll, and vertical vs. horizontal framing guidance.
4. Provide a short-form cut-down version (15-30 seconds) pulling the three most compelling moments from the full script for Instagram Reels and TikTok.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### MLS Description Framework

**Structure (lead with strength, close with lifestyle):**
1. **Opening hook** -- the single most compelling feature. "Completely renovated 4BR colonial on a half-acre corner lot in Maplewood." Not: "Welcome to this beautiful home."
2. **Key details** -- beds, baths, sqft, lot, garage, year built (if relevant), architectural style.
3. **Room-by-room highlights** -- focus on kitchen, primary suite, and any standout spaces. Use specific materials: "white oak hardwood floors," "carrara marble countertops," "Wolf 48-inch dual-fuel range."
4. **Updates and systems** -- renovations with year completed ("2024 kitchen renovation"), new roof, HVAC age, windows, water heater. Buyers and appraisers value this.
5. **Outdoor/lot features** -- deck, patio, fenced yard, mature landscaping, views, water features, outbuildings.
6. **Location/lifestyle close** -- proximity to downtowns, parks, trails, transit (use distance or drive time, not neighborhood demographics). "10-minute walk to Main Street shops and dining."
7. **CTA or scheduling note** -- "Showings begin Saturday. Schedule your private tour today."

**Words that sell (specific, sensory):** renovated, updated, custom, open-concept, sun-filled, designer, chef's kitchen, spa-like, private, mature landscaping, move-in ready, low-maintenance, energy-efficient, smart home, pre-inspected.

**Words to avoid (vague, overused, or problematic):**
- Vague: amazing, stunning, gorgeous, must-see, won't last, motivated seller, bring all offers
- Fair housing risk: family-friendly, perfect for young professionals, great neighborhood for [demographic], walking distance to [house of worship], master bedroom (use "primary bedroom"), man cave, mother-in-law suite (use "guest suite" or "accessory dwelling")
- MLS violations (check locally): all-caps text, agent phone/email in remarks, URLs, exclamation point overuse

### Social Media Platform Formats

**Instagram:**
- *Carousel post:* 5-10 slides, first slide is hero exterior or best interior shot with text overlay (address + price + key stat). Caption: 150-200 words, lifestyle-focused, end with CTA. 20-30 hashtags in first comment (not caption).
- *Reel:* 15-60 seconds. Hook in first 1.5 seconds ("Tour this [price] [style] in [neighborhood]"). Room-by-room with trending or ambient audio. Text overlay on key features. Caption: 50-100 words + hashtags.
- *Story sequence:* 5-8 slides. "New Listing" intro, exterior, kitchen, primary suite, unique feature, neighborhood, open house details, "DM for info" CTA with link sticker.

**Facebook:**
- *Full post:* 100-200 words. Property details + lifestyle narrative. 4-8 photos in album format. Tag location. Share to local community groups (where permitted). No hashtag overuse (0-3 max on Facebook).
- *Open house event:* Create Facebook Event with date, time, address, property highlights, and 3-5 photos.

**TikTok:**
- *Property tour:* 15-60 seconds. Hook: "POV: You just found your dream home in [neighborhood] for [price]." Walk-through with text callouts on features. Trending audio. End with "Follow for more [city] real estate."
- *Before/after or feature spotlight:* 15-30 seconds focusing on one standout element (kitchen renovation, backyard, view).

**LinkedIn:**
- *Professional post:* 150-250 words. Lead with market insight or investment angle, then present the listing in that context. "The [neighborhood] market saw 12% appreciation this year. This recently renovated colonial represents..." 1-3 photos. No hashtag spam (3-5 relevant tags).

### Hashtag Strategy

**Instagram (20-30 per post, in first comment):**
- Tier 1 (5-8): Hyperlocal -- #[City]RealEstate, #[Neighborhood]Homes, #[City]Realtor, #[County]HomesForSale
- Tier 2 (5-8): Property-specific -- #[Style]Home (e.g., #ColonialHome), #[Feature] (e.g., #ChefKitchen, #PoolHome), #NewListing
- Tier 3 (5-8): Industry broad -- #JustListed, #HouseHunting, #DreamHome, #HomeForSale, #RealEstate, #[State]RealEstate
- Tier 4 (2-4): Trending/seasonal -- #SpringMarket, #OpenHouseWeekend, #MovingDay

**TikTok (3-5 per post):**
- #[City]RealEstate, #HouseTour, #RealEstateAgent, #DreamHome, #HomeTour

**Facebook:** 0-3 hashtags maximum. Facebook's algorithm does not favor hashtag-heavy posts.

**LinkedIn:** 3-5 professional tags. #RealEstate, #[City]Market, #HomeBuying, #PropertyInvestment.

### Email Campaign Templates

**Just-Listed Announcement:**
- Subject: "New listing: [beds]BR in [neighborhood] -- $[price]" (under 50 chars when possible)
- Preview text: "[Key feature] + [second feature] at [price point]"
- Body: Hero photo, 2-3 sentence hook highlighting top features, bullet list of key details (beds/baths/sqft/garage/lot), 1-2 sentences on location/lifestyle, CTA button ("View Full Details" or "Schedule a Showing"), agent contact info with photo
- Length: 150-200 words maximum. Email is a click-through medium, not a reading medium.

**Open House Invitation:**
- Subject: "Open house this [day]: [address]"
- Preview text: "[Time] -- [neighborhood] -- [key feature]"
- Body: Date, time, address prominently displayed. 3-4 key property highlights. Map or directions link. "Can't make it? Schedule a private showing" alternate CTA. Agent contact.
- Length: 100-150 words.

**Price Change:**
- Subject: "Price update: [address] now $[new price]"
- Body: Brief, direct. New price, original price (strikethrough if HTML), key features reminder, urgency language ("Priced to reflect current market -- won't stay available long"), CTA.
- Length: 75-100 words.

**Just Sold / Under Contract:**
- Subject: "[Address] is under contract" or "Just sold in [neighborhood]"
- Body: Celebrate the sale (briefly), highlight the result ("sold in [X] days" or "multiple offers"), pivot to CTA: "Thinking about selling? The [neighborhood] market is active. Let's talk about your home's value."
- Length: 75-125 words. This is a lead generation email disguised as a status update.

### Direct Mail Copy (Just-Listed Postcard)

**Front:** Hero photo of property. Address in large text. Price. Beds/baths/sqft. One headline feature ("Fully Renovated | Half-Acre Lot | $499,000").

**Back:** 3-4 bullet points of top features. "Your neighbor's home is for sale -- and here's what it means for your home's value." (Farm angle.) Open house date/time if applicable. Agent photo, name, brokerage, phone, website. QR code linking to listing page or virtual tour.

**Neighborhood market report mailer (alternative):**
- Front: "Your [Neighborhood] Market Update" with 2-3 key stats (avg sale price, DOM, homes sold this month).
- Back: Featured listing with photo and details. "What's your home worth? Scan for a free analysis." Agent branding.

### Video Script Structure (60-90 Second Property Walkthrough)

```
[0-3 sec]  HOOK — Text overlay + voiceover:
           "Tour this [beds]BR [style] in [neighborhood] — listed at $[price]"
           Camera: Slow approach to front exterior, curb appeal shot.

[3-10 sec] EXTERIOR — Highlight architecture, landscaping, driveway, garage.
           VO: One sentence on curb appeal and lot.

[10-25 sec] MAIN LIVING — Foyer → living room → dining.
            VO: Call out flooring, ceiling height, natural light, open layout.
            Pause on best angle of the main living space.

[25-40 sec] KITCHEN — The money shot. Slow pan across countertops.
            VO: Name materials, appliances, island, storage.
            "Renovated in [year] with [specific materials]."

[40-55 sec] PRIMARY SUITE — Bedroom + bathroom.
            VO: Size, closet, en-suite highlights (double vanity, tile, shower).

[55-70 sec] STANDOUT FEATURE — Whatever makes this home unique.
            Pool, finished basement, view, outdoor kitchen, home office.
            VO: One compelling detail.

[70-85 sec] OUTDOOR/LIFESTYLE — Backyard, deck, patio, neighborhood context.
            VO: "Minutes from [downtown/parks/trails]."

[85-90 sec] CTA — Agent on camera or text overlay:
            "Schedule your private showing — link in bio / DM me / call [number]."
```

**For short-form (15-30 seconds):** Pull the three strongest moments -- typically exterior hook, kitchen money shot, and standout feature. Fast cuts. Text overlay on every clip. Trending audio.

### Content Timing for Maximum Reach

| Platform | Best Days | Best Times | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Instagram | Tu, We, Th | 11am-1pm, 7-9pm | Reels get pushed harder than static posts |
| Facebook | We, Th, Fr | 9-11am, 1-3pm | Community groups peak in evenings |
| TikTok | Tu, Th, Sa | 7-9am, 12-3pm, 7-11pm | Consistency matters more than timing |
| LinkedIn | Tu, We, Th | 8-10am | Early morning professional scroll |
| Email | Tu, We, Th | 10am or 2pm | Avoid Monday (inbox overload) and Friday (checked out) |

### Fair Housing Language Quick-Check

Before publishing ANY listing content, verify:
- No description of ideal buyer/occupant ("perfect for," "ideal for," "great for")
- No neighborhood demographic references (racial, ethnic, religious, age, familial)
- No proximity to houses of worship as a feature
- "Primary bedroom" not "master bedroom" (check your MLS convention)
- "Guest suite" or "accessory dwelling" not "mother-in-law suite" or "in-law apartment"
- No "exclusive" or "private" in a context that implies exclusion of protected classes
- School information: name and distance only, no quality judgments (no "top-rated" or "best schools")
- All language describes the PROPERTY and its FEATURES

Cross-reference `fair-housing-compliance` for the full framework and state-specific additions.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Speed and polish. Solo agents do not have a marketing coordinator -- they need content they can copy, paste, customize with their branding, and deploy in under 30 minutes. Provide complete, ready-to-use outputs with minimal editing required. Note which pieces to publish first and on what schedule.

**To team leaders:** Consistency and scalability. They need a repeatable listing launch process every agent on the team follows. Outputs should be templated enough for brand consistency but flexible enough for property variation. Emphasize that standardized marketing raises the whole team's brand perception.

**To broker/owners:** Compliance and brand protection. They care that every listing marketed under their brokerage name is fair-housing compliant, accurate, and professionally presented. Highlight the compliance safeguards built into every output and note where broker review is recommended before publishing.

**To new agents:** Education embedded in execution. New agents often do not know what a good MLS description looks like or how to structure a social media campaign. Provide the content AND brief explanations of why it works -- "We lead with the kitchen because it is the most-searched feature" -- so they learn the craft while using the output.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Full Listing Launch for a Mid-Range Suburban Home

**User says:** "I just listed a 4BR/2.5BA colonial in Oakridge for $485,000. Built in 1998, renovated kitchen in 2023 with quartz counters and stainless appliances. Hardwood floors on the main level. Half-acre lot with fenced backyard. Two-car garage. New roof 2022. I need everything -- MLS description, social posts, email, the works."

**Actions:**
1. Generate the full package. Begin with the MLS description -- primary remarks (lead with the 2023 kitchen renovation as the strongest selling hook) and extended remarks (expand to outdoor space, systems updates, and Oakridge location/lifestyle).
2. Create Instagram content: carousel caption highlighting the kitchen renovation and fenced half-acre, Reel script for a 45-second walkthrough (hook on the kitchen, feature the backyard, close with exterior curb appeal), and a 6-slide Story sequence.
3. Create Facebook post (150 words, album format with photo guidance) and an Open House event template if the agent plans one.
4. Create TikTok script: 30-second tour -- "POV: your new home in Oakridge has a brand new chef's kitchen and a half-acre backyard for under $500K."
5. Write the just-listed email (subject: "New in Oakridge: Renovated 4BR colonial -- $485K") with bullet-point details and CTA.
6. Write the just-listed postcard back copy with top features and a "What's your home worth?" farm angle.
7. Write a 75-second video walkthrough script starting with the exterior approach, moving through the renovated kitchen (the hero room), through the main level hardwoods, up to the primary suite, and closing on the backyard.

### Scenario 2: MLS Description for a Luxury Listing

**User says:** "I need a killer MLS description for a $1.2M modern farmhouse. 5BR/4BA, 4,200 sqft, built 2021. White oak floors throughout, chef's kitchen with Sub-Zero and Wolf, primary suite with heated floors and freestanding tub. 2 acres with mountain views. Pool with pool house. Wine cellar."

**Actions:**
1. Write elevated, detail-rich copy that matches the luxury price point. Lead with the setting: "Modern farmhouse on 2 private acres with panoramic mountain views." Luxury buyers lead with lifestyle and setting, not bedroom count.
2. Primary remarks (500 chars): Focus on the trifecta -- mountain views, 2-acre setting, and the caliber of finishes (Sub-Zero, Wolf, white oak, heated floors). Close with pool and pool house.
3. Extended remarks: Room-by-room with material specificity. Name every brand, finish, and detail. "Wine cellar with climate-controlled storage for 200+ bottles." Luxury descriptions earn their length by being precise, not by being verbose.
4. Avoid overused luxury descriptors ("exquisite," "one-of-a-kind"). Let the details carry the weight. "Freestanding soaking tub positioned beneath a floor-to-ceiling window framing the western mountain ridgeline" is more effective than "stunning primary bathroom."
5. Note: verify square footage source (tax records vs. appraised vs. builder plans) and acreage against survey before publishing. Luxury listings get scrutinized.

### Scenario 3: Social Media Posts for an Open House

**User says:** "I have an open house this Sunday 1-3pm for my listing at 42 Elm Street. It's a 3BR/2BA ranch, $325K, updated kitchen, big backyard, quiet street. Can you create social posts to promote it?"

**Actions:**
1. Create an Instagram post: photo guidance (exterior hero shot or kitchen), caption with open house details (date, time, address), 3 feature highlights, CTA ("Stop by Sunday or DM for a private tour"), and a hashtag set targeting the local market.
2. Create an Instagram Story sequence: "Open House This Sunday" announcement slide, 3 feature slides with quick callouts (kitchen, backyard, street shot), details slide (date/time/address), "Save this post" or "Share with a friend who's looking" CTA slide.
3. Create a Facebook post: slightly longer narrative (100-150 words), include all logistics, tag the location, and suggest the agent share to 2-3 local community groups where allowed.
4. Create a Facebook Event with the date, time, address, description, and photo.
5. Suggest a TikTok teaser: 15-second clip -- "Open house this Sunday in [neighborhood] -- here's a sneak peek" with 3 quick room shots and text overlay of the details.
6. Recommend posting schedule: Instagram and Facebook posts on Thursday (3 days before), Story reminders on Saturday, and a "See you today!" Story on Sunday morning.

### Scenario 4: Just-Sold Content for Lead Generation

**User says:** "I just closed on 18 Birch Lane -- sold in 6 days with multiple offers, $12K over asking. I want to turn this into marketing content."

**Actions:**
1. Create a "Just Sold" Instagram post: photo of the exterior (or closing day photo if available). Caption structure: celebrate the result ("Sold in 6 days, $12K over asking in [neighborhood]"), brief market insight ("This is what happens when pricing strategy meets a prepared marketing launch"), and pivot to CTA ("Thinking about selling? Let's talk about what your home could command in this market. Link in bio.").
2. Create a Facebook post with the same structure but longer narrative (150-200 words) that tells the story: "When my sellers asked me how to get top dollar in this market, we focused on three things..." (pricing, preparation, marketing). This positions the agent as strategic, not just lucky.
3. Create a just-sold postcard for the neighborhood: front has the property photo, "JUST SOLD" banner, sale details (address, sold price, days on market). Back: "Your neighbor's home just sold for $[price] in [X] days. Wondering what your home is worth? Scan the QR code for a free market analysis."
4. Write a just-sold email to the database: subject line "Just Sold: [Address] -- [X] Days, [X] Offers." Short body celebrating the result, market context, and CTA for anyone considering selling. Cross-reference `client-communication` for the broader post-close follow-up sequence.
5. Remind the agent: just-sold content is the single best lead generation tool for future listings. Every just-sold post should end with a CTA directed at potential sellers.

## Important Caveats

- **Fair housing compliance is embedded in every output, but the agent must still review.** This skill avoids prohibited language by default, but regional fair housing additions (state and local protected classes) vary. Agents must verify compliance with their state and local laws before publishing. Cross-reference `fair-housing-compliance`.
- **MLS rules vary by market.** Character limits, prohibited terms, photo requirements, and remarks field rules differ across the 500+ MLSs nationwide. Always verify your MLS-specific rules before submitting descriptions. Some MLSs prohibit agent contact info in remarks, URLs, all-caps, or certain promotional language.
- **CAN-SPAM and TCPA compliance applies to email and text marketing.** Every marketing email must include a physical address and unsubscribe mechanism. Text messages require prior express consent. This skill generates content; the agent is responsible for delivery compliance.
- **This skill generates content, not strategy.** For listing marketing strategy (when to launch, how much to spend, which channels to prioritize), cross-reference `listing-services`. For client communication templates beyond listing marketing, cross-reference `client-communication`.
- **Verify all property details before publishing.** AI-generated content is based on the details the agent provides. Square footage, lot size, year of renovations, HOA information, and other facts must be verified against MLS records, tax records, or seller disclosures before any content goes live. Inaccurate marketing creates liability.
- **Photography and video quality matter more than copy.** The best MLS description in the world cannot overcome poor photos. Professional photography is the prerequisite -- this skill assumes the agent has professional media or is arranging it. Phone photos undermine every piece of content generated here.
