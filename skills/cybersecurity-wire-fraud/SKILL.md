# Cybersecurity & Wire Fraud Prevention

The security and risk management skill for real estate professionals. Wire fraud costs the real estate industry $150M+ annually, and agents are the most common entry point for Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks because every transaction involves large wire transfers, sensitive client data, and dozens of email exchanges between parties who may never meet in person. This skill covers wire fraud prevention, email and account security, client data handling, E&O insurance, cyber liability, TCPA and CAN-SPAM compliance, state privacy law awareness, and incident response -- the full spectrum of threats that can destroy an agent's career, a client's life savings, or a brokerage's reputation in a single transaction.

## Core Principles

1. **Verify everything, trust nothing.** Wire instructions, closing details, and payment requests must be verified through a separate, trusted communication channel before any action is taken. The phone number used for verification must be independently looked up -- never taken from the message being verified. Convenience is not worth $400,000.
2. **Minimize, encrypt, delete.** Collect only the client data you actually need. Encrypt it in transit and at rest. Delete it when the transaction is complete. Every piece of sensitive data you hold is a liability if compromised. The agent who stores three years of client SSNs in their Gmail is a breach waiting to happen.
3. **Document your security practices -- they are your defense.** When a wire fraud loss occurs, when an E&O claim is filed, when a data breach is reported, the first question is: what were your procedures? If the answer is "I didn't have any," liability shifts squarely to you. Written protocols, client warnings, and verification records are your shield.

## Instructions

### How to Respond to Cybersecurity & Risk Management Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Wire Fraud Prevention & Verification

Includes: wire fraud, wiring instructions, closing wire, how to verify wiring instructions, changed wiring instructions, suspicious email about closing funds, wire transfer security, funds transfer, earnest money wire.

**Workflow:**
1. Treat every wire fraud question with urgency. If the user suspects active fraud (e.g., "someone changed the wiring instructions"), skip education and go straight to the incident response protocol in Category E.
2. Provide the Wire Fraud Prevention Protocol: (a) obtain wiring instructions directly from the title company or closing attorney in person or by phone using a known number, (b) never accept wiring instructions received solely by email, (c) if wiring instructions change for any reason, assume fraud until verified by phone, (d) verify the receiving bank and account before initiating the transfer, (e) call the title company after sending the wire to confirm receipt.
3. Explain the BEC attack pattern: criminals compromise an email account (agent, lender, title, or client), monitor the transaction for weeks, then send fraudulent wiring instructions timed to closing. The spoofed email often looks identical to the real sender with one character changed.
4. Recommend that the agent issue a written wire fraud warning to every client at two points: (a) at the start of the transaction (in the welcome packet or first communication), and (b) 5-7 days before closing with specific instructions on how the client will receive legitimate wiring details.
5. Cross-reference `transaction-coordinator` for wire transfer timing within the closing process.

#### Category B: Email & Account Security

Includes: email hacked, phishing, suspicious email, account security, 2FA, two-factor authentication, password management, email compromise, spoofed email, how to secure my accounts, malware.

**Workflow:**
1. If the user reports an active compromise ("my email was hacked"), treat as an incident -- go to Category E.
2. Provide the essential security checklist: (a) enable 2FA on every account used for business -- email, CRM, MLS, banking, social media, cloud storage; (b) use unique, strong passwords for every account (minimum 16 characters, password manager recommended); (c) never click links in unexpected emails -- go directly to the website instead; (d) review email forwarding rules monthly (criminals add hidden forwarding rules to intercepted accounts); (e) use a business email domain rather than a free provider when possible.
3. Explain phishing red flags specific to real estate: urgent requests to change wiring instructions, "updated" closing documents with links, emails from addresses that differ by one character from known contacts, messages pressuring immediate action ("wire must go out today or closing will be delayed").
4. Recommend encrypted email or secure portals for transmitting sensitive documents (tax returns, bank statements, pre-approval letters, identification). Standard email is not secure.

#### Category C: Client Data Protection & Privacy Compliance

Includes: client data security, TCPA, CAN-SPAM, CCPA, data privacy, protecting client information, data breach obligations, text message compliance, email marketing rules, AI and client data, storing client documents.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the specific concern: data handling practices, marketing compliance (TCPA/CAN-SPAM), or state privacy law obligations.
2. For data handling: apply the minimize-encrypt-delete framework. Agents should collect only what is necessary for the transaction, never store SSNs or financial documents in unencrypted email or personal cloud storage, use secure file-sharing platforms with access controls, and delete or securely archive sensitive data after closing.
3. For TCPA compliance: written prior express consent is required before sending marketing text messages. The consent must be clear, documented, and revocable. Violations carry penalties of $500-$1,500 per message. TCPA lawsuits against real estate agents are increasing rapidly. Transactional texts (closing updates, showing confirmations) to existing clients in an active transaction are generally permitted, but marketing texts to leads require consent.
4. For CAN-SPAM compliance: all marketing emails must include a clear opt-out mechanism, the sender's physical mailing address, honest subject lines, and clear identification as an advertisement. Opt-out requests must be honored within 10 business days.
5. For state privacy laws: California (CCPA/CPRA), Virginia (VCDPA), Colorado (CPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and others impose data protection obligations. If the agent operates in or has clients in these states, they must understand the right to know, right to delete, and right to opt-out provisions. Brokerages with significant client databases may need privacy policies and data processing agreements.
6. For AI and client data: never input client PII (names, addresses, SSNs, financial details) into public AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude consumer, Gemini, or similar). Platform-integrated AI with proper data handling agreements is different from pasting client data into a public chat interface. When in doubt, anonymize first.

#### Category D: E&O Insurance & Professional Liability

Includes: E&O insurance, errors and omissions, professional liability, cyber liability insurance, E&O claim, what does E&O cover, do I need cyber insurance, insurance requirements, claim filed against me, how to avoid E&O claims.

**Workflow:**
1. Clarify the question type: understanding coverage, evaluating whether to add cyber liability, or responding to an active claim.
2. For coverage questions: explain that E&O insurance covers claims arising from professional negligence, misrepresentation, failure to disclose, missed deadlines, and unauthorized practice of law. It pays legal defense costs and settlements. Typical cost: $200-$500/year for agents. Most brokerages require it. Key exclusions: intentional fraud, bodily injury, property damage, criminal acts, and claims arising from activities outside the scope of licensed real estate practice.
3. For cyber liability: this is separate from E&O and covers data breaches, ransomware, and fraud-related losses. It is increasingly important as agents hold more digital data and face more cyber threats. Cost is typically $100-$300/year for individual agents. Brokerages should carry both E&O and cyber liability.
4. For E&O claim prevention: the top five practices are (a) disclose everything material -- when in doubt, disclose, (b) never give legal, tax, structural, or environmental advice -- refer to professionals, (c) document every communication and decision in writing, (d) meet every contractual deadline or formally amend the timeline, (e) use only brokerage-approved or state-approved forms and never draft contract language from scratch.
5. For an active claim: do not discuss the claim with anyone except your broker and the E&O carrier. Notify the carrier immediately -- late notification can void coverage. Do not admit fault or offer to settle. Cooperate fully with the carrier's investigation. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for the regulatory dimensions of common claim triggers.

#### Category E: Incident Response

Includes: I think we've been hacked, wire fraud happened, data breach, client data exposed, what do I do now, someone sent fake wiring instructions, funds sent to wrong account, ransomware.

**Workflow:**
1. Determine the type of incident: wire fraud (funds misdirected), email compromise (account taken over), data breach (client information exposed), or other security incident.
2. For wire fraud in progress or just discovered: (a) contact the sending bank IMMEDIATELY -- within the first 24 hours, banks can sometimes initiate a recall or freeze on the receiving account; (b) file an FBI IC3 complaint at ic3.gov -- the FBI's Recovery Asset Team has recovered funds in some cases when notified within 72 hours; (c) notify the title company, closing attorney, and all transaction parties; (d) notify local law enforcement; (e) document everything -- timestamps, communications, account numbers, amounts.
3. For email compromise: (a) change the password on the compromised account immediately from a different, trusted device; (b) enable 2FA if not already active; (c) check for and remove any unauthorized forwarding rules, connected apps, or delegated access; (d) notify all transaction parties that the account was compromised and that any instructions received from it should be reverified; (e) scan all devices for malware.
4. For data breaches: (a) contain the breach -- secure the affected system or account; (b) assess what data was exposed (names, SSNs, financial records); (c) notify the brokerage broker immediately; (d) determine notification obligations -- most states require notification of affected individuals within 30-60 days if personal information was exposed; (e) file with the state attorney general if required by state law.
5. In all cases: notify the brokerage broker, notify the E&O and/or cyber liability carrier, and document the incident and response in writing. Preservation of evidence is critical.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Wire Fraud by the Numbers

- $150M+ in reported losses annually in real estate (FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center)
- Average loss per incident: $150,000-$400,000+ (often a buyer's entire down payment or closing funds)
- Recovery rate: extremely low -- under 30% of funds are recovered, and full recovery is rare
- Attack vector: 80%+ involve Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- Timing: criminals strike at closing when urgency is highest and large sums are moving
- Target: any party in the transaction -- buyer, seller, agent, lender, title company, or attorney

### Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attack Pattern

1. **Reconnaissance:** Criminal identifies a real estate transaction via public MLS listing, social media announcement, or data scraping.
2. **Compromise:** Criminal gains access to one party's email through phishing, credential stuffing, or malware. Title companies and agents are frequent targets because a single compromised account exposes dozens of transactions.
3. **Monitoring:** Criminal reads email silently for days or weeks, learning the transaction timeline, the parties involved, and the communication style.
4. **Execution:** Timed to closing, the criminal sends fraudulent wiring instructions from the compromised account (or a spoofed address one character off), often with urgency language: "Updated wiring instructions -- please use these instead" or "The wire must go out today."
5. **Exfiltration:** Funds are wired to a criminal-controlled account and moved internationally within hours.

### Wire Fraud Red Flags

- Wiring instructions received by email only (no phone verification)
- Wiring instructions that change at the last minute
- Urgency language: "wire must go out immediately," "do not call to verify"
- Email address differs by one character from the known contact
- Instructions to wire to a personal bank account rather than a title company escrow account
- Request to keep the change confidential
- Grammar errors, unusual formatting, or different email signature

### E&O Insurance -- What Agents Need to Know

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| What it covers | Professional negligence, misrepresentation, failure to disclose, missed deadlines, unauthorized practice of law |
| What it excludes | Intentional fraud, bodily injury, property damage, criminal acts, discrimination (covered by general liability or separate policy) |
| Typical cost | $200-$500/year for individual agents; $1,000-$5,000/year for brokerages |
| Required? | By most brokerages, yes. By state law, varies -- some states require it for licensure |
| Defense costs | Covered even if the claim is ultimately dismissed. Legal defense alone averages $10,000-$50,000 |
| Claim triggers | #1: failure to disclose known defects. #2: misrepresentation (square footage, boundaries, condition). #3: missed contractual deadlines. #4: unauthorized practice of law. #5: failure to present offers |
| Notice requirement | Must notify carrier immediately when a claim is filed or when an incident likely to result in a claim occurs. Late notice can void coverage. |

### Top 5 E&O Claim Prevention Practices

1. **Disclose, disclose, disclose.** When in doubt, put it in writing. Agents who over-disclose face no penalty. Agents who under-disclose face lawsuits.
2. **Stay in your lane.** Never give legal advice ("I think that clause means..."), tax advice ("You should probably do a 1031..."), structural opinions ("That crack is nothing"), or environmental assessments ("There's no mold issue"). Refer to professionals and document the referral.
3. **Document everything.** Every material conversation, every client decision, every recommendation, every disclosure -- in writing, saved to the transaction file. Verbal agreements and recollections lose to written records every time.
4. **Meet every deadline.** Missed contingency deadlines, late disclosures, and expired contracts are direct liability. Calendar every deadline, set alerts, and confirm completion. Cross-reference `transaction-coordinator` for deadline management.
5. **Use approved forms only.** Never draft contract language, addenda, or legal clauses. Use only brokerage-approved or state association-approved forms. Complete the blanks; do not modify the boilerplate.

### TCPA Compliance for Real Estate Agents

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Marketing texts | Require prior express written consent. Must include clear identification and opt-out. |
| Marketing calls (auto-dialer) | Require prior express written consent for cell phones. Do Not Call list must be checked. |
| Transactional messages | Generally permitted to existing clients in active transactions without marketing consent. |
| Penalties | $500 per violation (negligent), $1,500 per violation (willful). Class action exposure is significant. |
| Consent documentation | Must be retained. Screenshots of web forms, signed consent language, or text-based opt-in records. |
| Opt-out | Must be honored immediately. "STOP" reply must trigger automatic removal from marketing lists. |
| Do Not Call | National DNC registry must be checked before cold calling. Internal DNC list must be maintained. |

### CAN-SPAM Requirements for Email Marketing

- Every marketing email must include: (a) clear opt-out mechanism, (b) sender's physical mailing address, (c) honest subject line that reflects the content, (d) identification as an advertisement if applicable.
- Opt-out requests must be processed within 10 business days.
- Cannot use deceptive headers, misleading subject lines, or harvested email addresses.
- Transactional emails (closing updates, document requests) are exempt from most requirements, but mixing marketing content into transactional emails triggers full compliance obligations.

### State Privacy Law Landscape

| State | Law | Key Requirements |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| California | CCPA/CPRA | Right to know, delete, opt-out of sale. Privacy policy required. Applies to businesses with $25M+ revenue, 100K+ consumer records, or 50%+ revenue from selling data. |
| Virginia | VCDPA | Similar rights to CCPA. Applies to businesses processing 100K+ consumers or 25K+ consumers with 50%+ revenue from data sales. |
| Colorado | CPA | Right to access, correct, delete, opt-out. Universal opt-out mechanism required. |
| Connecticut | CTDPA | Similar to Virginia. Data protection assessments required for high-risk processing. |
| Other states | Evolving | Texas, Oregon, Montana, and others have enacted or are considering privacy legislation. Monitor your state. |

**Practical impact for agents:** Most individual agents fall below the thresholds of these laws. However, brokerages with large client databases may be covered. Regardless of legal obligation, following data minimization and security best practices protects against liability and builds client trust.

### AI-Specific Data Privacy Considerations

- Public AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude consumer, Gemini) may retain inputs for model training. Never input client PII -- names, addresses, SSNs, financial details, or transaction specifics.
- If using AI for document drafting or analysis, anonymize client data first or use a platform with enterprise-grade data handling agreements.
- AI-generated content should be reviewed for accuracy before sending to clients, opposing parties, or regulators. AI errors in contract language or compliance guidance create agent liability.
- Inform clients if AI tools are being used to process their information, where disclosure is required by your brokerage policy or applicable law.

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Direct and practical. They are handling security on their own with no IT department. Give them specific actions they can implement today -- enable 2FA, set up a wire verification protocol, issue client warnings. Do not overwhelm with policy frameworks. Prioritize the actions that prevent the highest-dollar losses first (wire fraud prevention, then email security, then data handling).

**To team leaders:** Systems-focused. They need to implement security practices across their team, not just for themselves. Focus on creating written protocols, training checklists, and accountability measures. One compromised team member can expose every transaction the team touches. Emphasize that team leaders bear responsibility for their agents' security practices.

**To broker/owners:** Liability and compliance-focused. They carry vicarious liability for agent security failures and regulatory violations. Focus on brokerage-wide security policies, TCPA/CAN-SPAM compliance programs, E&O and cyber liability coverage, client data handling protocols, and incident response plans. A single wire fraud incident or data breach can generate six-figure liability and reputational damage. Brokerages must have written cybersecurity policies and train agents at least annually.

**To new agents:** Foundational and non-negotiable. New agents are the most vulnerable because they have the least experience identifying threats and the most enthusiasm for using any tool available (including inputting client data into AI chatbots). Start with the three non-negotiables: (1) enable 2FA on everything, (2) never send or accept wire instructions by email alone, (3) never store client SSNs or financial documents in your personal email. Build from there.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Agent Receives Suspicious Wiring Instructions Before Closing

**User says:** "I just got an email from the title company with updated wiring instructions. The wire needs to go out tomorrow. Something feels off but I'm not sure."

**Actions:**
1. Trust the instinct. Treat this as a potential wire fraud attempt until proven otherwise. Do NOT forward the instructions to the client.
2. Immediately call the title company using a phone number you independently look up -- from their website, your original engagement letter, or your saved contacts. Do NOT use any phone number from the suspicious email.
3. Ask the title company: "Did you send updated wiring instructions by email today?" If they say no, you have confirmed an attempted fraud. Do not respond to the suspicious email. Report it to your broker, the title company, and file an FBI IC3 complaint.
4. If the title company confirms the instructions are legitimate, ask them to verify the account number and routing number by phone. Even legitimate changes warrant phone verification.
5. When forwarding verified instructions to the client, include your brokerage's wire fraud warning: "We will never ask you to change wiring instructions by email. Before wiring any funds, call [title company name] directly at [verified phone number] to confirm."
6. Document the verification call in your transaction file: date, time, who you spoke with, and what was confirmed. This is your record if a dispute arises.

### Scenario 2: Agent Discovers Their Email Has Been Compromised

**User says:** "I just found out someone has been reading my email. A client told me they got a weird email from my account that I didn't send. I have active transactions closing this month."

**Actions:**
1. This is an active incident. Act immediately: (a) change your email password from a trusted device (not the compromised device); (b) enable 2FA if not already active; (c) review and remove any forwarding rules, connected third-party apps, or delegated access you did not set up. Criminals commonly add hidden forwarding rules that survive a password change.
2. Notify every party in every active transaction that your email was compromised. Specifically warn them: (a) do not act on any instructions received from your email address until they verify by phone, (b) wiring instructions received from your account should be disregarded and reverified directly with the title company, (c) any document requests or changes to transaction terms should be confirmed by phone.
3. Notify your broker immediately. The brokerage may need to issue a broader notification if the criminal accessed transaction files, client data, or brokerage systems through your account.
4. Scan all devices (computer, phone, tablet) for malware. Consider having a professional review your devices if the compromise involved clicking a link or downloading a file.
5. Assess what data was accessible: client names, addresses, SSNs, financial documents, transaction details. If sensitive client information was exposed, the brokerage may have state-mandated notification obligations. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for disclosure requirements.
6. File an FBI IC3 report at ic3.gov. Even if no financial loss occurred, reporting helps law enforcement track patterns and may protect you if losses emerge later.

### Scenario 3: Broker Asking About E&O Coverage and Cyber Liability

**User says:** "One of my agents is being sued for not disclosing a basement water issue. Also, I've been hearing about cyber liability insurance. Do I need that on top of E&O?"

**Actions:**
1. For the active E&O claim: the brokerage and the agent must notify the E&O carrier immediately if not already done. Late notice can void coverage. Neither the agent nor the broker should discuss the claim with the claimant, admit fault, or attempt to settle independently. The carrier will assign legal counsel.
2. Key question: did the agent know about the water issue? If the agent knew and failed to disclose, E&O typically covers the defense and any settlement (failure to disclose is a covered "wrongful act"). If the agent actively concealed it or participated in fraud, the carrier may deny coverage under the intentional acts exclusion.
3. For cyber liability: yes, a separate cyber liability policy is strongly recommended for brokerages. E&O does not typically cover data breaches, ransomware, wire fraud losses to the brokerage, or costs associated with client notification after a breach. Cyber liability covers: forensic investigation, client notification costs, credit monitoring, legal defense for privacy claims, and sometimes ransom payments.
4. Typical cyber liability cost for a brokerage: $500-$2,000/year depending on size and coverage limits. For the exposure involved (one wire fraud incident can exceed $200,000), this is inexpensive protection.
5. Recommend: review the current E&O policy to understand exclusions, add cyber liability if not already in place, and implement the foundational security practices (2FA, wire verification protocol, written security policy, annual agent training) that cyber insurers increasingly require for coverage.

### Scenario 4: Agent Unsure About TCPA Compliance for Text Marketing

**User says:** "I want to start texting my lead database with market updates and new listings. My CRM lets me send mass texts. Am I allowed to just send these?"

**Actions:**
1. No -- not without proper consent. Mass marketing texts require prior express written consent under the TCPA. Sending unsolicited marketing texts to leads without consent violates federal law and exposes the agent to $500-$1,500 per text message in penalties. A blast to 500 contacts without consent is $250,000-$750,000 in potential liability.
2. How to get compliant: (a) add clear, conspicuous opt-in language to your lead capture forms -- "By providing your phone number, you consent to receive marketing text messages from [agent name] at [brokerage]. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt-out." (b) Document the consent -- save the form submission record. (c) Honor every opt-out immediately and automatically.
3. Segment the database: contacts who provided written consent for text marketing can receive mass texts. Contacts who only provided their phone number for a showing request or transaction communication have NOT consented to marketing texts. Do not text them marketing content.
4. Every marketing text must include: identification of who is sending it, and instructions on how to opt-out (typically "Reply STOP to unsubscribe").
5. Use the CRM's consent tracking features to tag which contacts have opt-in consent and which do not. If the CRM does not track consent, the agent must maintain their own records. Cross-reference `crm-tech-advisor` for CRM compliance features.

### Scenario 5: New Agent Asking About Basic Security Setup

**User says:** "I just got my license and I'm setting up my business. What do I need to do for security? I'm using my personal phone and Gmail for everything."

**Actions:**
1. Start with the three non-negotiables that prevent the highest-cost incidents:
   - **Enable 2FA on every account:** Gmail, MLS, CRM, banking, social media, cloud storage. Use an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) rather than SMS-based 2FA when possible. This single step blocks the majority of account takeovers.
   - **Establish a wire fraud verification protocol:** Before your first closing, memorize this rule: never accept wiring instructions by email alone. Always verify by phone using an independently obtained number. Communicate this to every client in writing at the start of every transaction.
   - **Do not store client financial documents in Gmail.** Tax returns, bank statements, pre-approval letters, and identification documents should go into a secure, encrypted file-sharing platform (your brokerage may provide one). Your personal Gmail is not secure storage.
2. Additional setup: use a unique, strong password for every account (password manager strongly recommended -- Bitwarden and 1Password are popular options). Do not reuse passwords across accounts.
3. Business email: consider setting up a professional email address (yourname@yourbrokerage.com or a custom domain) rather than using a free Gmail address. This is both a security and credibility improvement.
4. Phone security: enable a passcode or biometric lock on your phone. Enable remote wipe capability (Find My iPhone / Find My Device) in case of loss or theft. Your phone contains access to email, MLS, client contacts, and potentially financial accounts.
5. Learn to recognize phishing: before clicking any link in an email, hover over it to verify the URL. Be especially suspicious of emails about closing details, wire transfers, document signatures, or account verification. When in doubt, go directly to the website rather than clicking the link.
6. Ask your brokerage about their security policies, document storage systems, and whether they provide cybersecurity training. Many brokerages have existing protocols -- use them.

## Important Caveats

- **Wire fraud recovery is time-sensitive.** If funds are misdirected, the sending bank must be contacted within 24 hours for the best chance of recovery. After 72 hours, recovery rates drop dramatically. Speed is everything.
- **This skill does not provide legal advice.** E&O claims, data breach notification obligations, TCPA litigation, and privacy law compliance are legal matters. Agents should consult their broker and, when necessary, an attorney. The guidance here establishes best practices, not legal opinions.
- **State laws vary significantly.** Data breach notification requirements, privacy law obligations, E&O insurance requirements, and TCPA enforcement vary by state. Verify requirements with your state's real estate commission and attorney general's office.
- **Cybersecurity threats evolve constantly.** The specific attack methods, phishing techniques, and fraud patterns described here reflect current (2024-2026) threats. New methods emerge regularly. Agents and brokerages should participate in ongoing security training at least annually.
- **E&O insurance policies vary.** Coverage, exclusions, deductibles, and claim procedures differ between carriers and policies. Agents should read their actual policy -- not rely on general descriptions. Key questions: What is the per-claim and aggregate limit? What is the deductible? Does it cover defense costs in addition to or within the limit? Is cyber liability included or separate?
- **AI tool usage and client data is an evolving area.** As AI tools become more integrated into real estate workflows, data handling practices must keep pace. Follow your brokerage's AI usage policy. When no policy exists, default to: do not input identifiable client information into any tool without understanding how that data is stored, used, and retained.
- **Cross-reference `transaction-coordinator` for wire transfer timing and closing coordination.** Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for regulatory obligations related to disclosures, record retention, and advertising compliance that intersect with security practices.
