## 1. Side-by-Side Loan Program Comparison

| Feature | Conventional | FHA | VA | USDA | Jumbo |
|---------|-------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Min Down Payment** | 3% (first-time) / 5% (standard) | 3.5% (580+ credit) / 10% (500-579) | 0% | 0% | 10-20% (lender varies) |
| **Credit Score Min** | 620 (most lenders 640+) | 580 (3.5% down) / 500 (10% down) | No VA minimum; lenders typically 620+ | 640 (most lenders) | 700-720+ |
| **PMI / Mortgage Insurance** | PMI if <20% down; removable at 80% LTV | Upfront MIP 1.75% + annual 0.55%; permanent if <10% down | No PMI; VA funding fee 1.25-3.3% (waived for disabled vets) | Upfront guarantee fee 1% + annual 0.35% | Varies by lender; some require none with 20%+ down |
| **Loan Limits (2025)** | $766,550 conforming / $1,149,825 high-cost | $498,257 floor / $1,149,825 high-cost ceiling | No loan limit (entitlement-based) | No stated limit; based on area median income and appraised value | Above conforming limit; no cap |
| **Max DTI (Back-End)** | 45-50% (with compensating factors) | 43-57% (with compensating factors) | No hard cap; residual income test required | 41% (some flexibility to 44%) | 38-43% (stricter than conforming) |
| **Property Requirements** | Standard appraisal; fewest restrictions | FHA appraisal with health/safety standards; stricter on condition | VA appraisal with Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs); moderately strict | USDA appraisal; property must be in eligible rural area | Standard appraisal; may require two appraisals |
| **Seller Concession Limit** | 3% (<10% down), 6% (10-25% down), 9% (>25% down) | 6% of sale price | 4% of sale price (different definition — includes prepaids but NOT discount points) | 6% of sale price | Varies; typically 3-6% |
| **Closing Cost Estimate** | 2-4% of purchase price | 3-5% (higher due to upfront MIP) | 2-4% (no down payment but funding fee) | 2-4% (guarantee fee can be financed) | 2-4% (may be higher for larger loan amounts) |
| **Typical Closing Time** | 30-45 days | 30-60 days | 30-60 days (COE verification adds time) | 45-60 days (rural property + income verification) | 45-60 days (additional underwriting) |
| **Occupancy** | Primary, second home, investment | Primary residence only | Primary residence only | Primary residence only | Primary, second home (investment rare) |
| **Assumable?** | No | Yes (with lender approval) | Yes (with lender approval) | Yes (with lender approval) | Generally no |
| **Best For** | Buyers with 5-20%+ down, 680+ credit, wanting PMI removal | Lower credit buyers, first-time buyers with limited down payment | Military/veteran/surviving spouse buyers | Rural and suburban buyers with moderate income | High-price-point buyers in expensive markets |

---

## 2. Conventional Loans — Detail

**Backed by:** Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Government-Sponsored Enterprises). Not government-insured.

**Key Features:**
- Most flexible loan product for property types (primary, second home, investment)
- PMI cancellation at 80% LTV (borrower request) or 78% LTV (automatic) -- this is a major advantage over FHA
- No upfront mortgage insurance premium
- Multiple down payment options: 3% (HomeReady/Home Possible for income-qualified first-time buyers), 5% standard, 10%, 15%, 20%+ (no PMI)
- Gift funds allowed for down payment (with documentation)
- Rate pricing improves significantly with higher credit scores (740+ gets best pricing)

**What Agents Should Know:**
- Best rate pricing requires 740+ credit and 20%+ down; every step down in either metric increases cost
- PMI costs vary widely by credit score: a 740-credit buyer might pay 0.3% annually; a 660-credit buyer might pay 1.2%
- Conventional appraisals are the least restrictive -- fewer property condition issues than FHA/VA
- Condos must be on the Fannie/Freddie approved list or get a project review (can add 1-2 weeks)
- Investment property conventional loans require 15-25% down and carry higher rates (typically 0.5-1% above primary residence rates)

**Pros:** PMI removable, flexible property types, fastest closings, fewest property condition issues, best pricing for high-credit borrowers.

**Cons:** Higher credit score needed for competitive pricing, PMI cost can be significant for low-down-payment buyers with moderate credit, stricter DTI limits than FHA.

---

## 3. FHA Loans — Detail

**Backed by:** Federal Housing Administration (part of HUD). Government-insured.

**Key Features:**
- Lower credit threshold: 580 for 3.5% down; 500-579 for 10% down
- Higher DTI tolerance: up to 57% back-end with strong compensating factors
- MIP is required regardless of down payment
- Upfront MIP: 1.75% of loan amount (can be financed into the loan)
- Annual MIP: 0.55% for most borrowers (30-year term, LTV >95%)
- MIP duration: permanent if down payment is less than 10%; drops off after 11 years if 10%+ down
- FHA loan limits vary by county (check HUD website)
- Gift funds allowed for entire down payment (from eligible donors)

**What Agents Should Know:**
- FHA appraisals are stricter than conventional: peeling paint on pre-1978 homes (lead paint), broken windows, non-functional systems, safety hazards, and inadequate access must be remedied before closing
- The FHA appraisal "sticks" to the property for 120 days -- if the buyer walks away, the next FHA buyer sees the same appraisal
- Condos: FHA has its own condo approval list (separate from Fannie/Freddie) and the process is more restrictive
- MIP permanence is the biggest drawback: a buyer putting 5% down never escapes MIP unless they refinance to a conventional loan after reaching 20% equity
- Seller concessions up to 6% -- the highest limit of any standard loan type for low-down-payment buyers

**Pros:** Accessible to lower-credit buyers, high DTI tolerance, low down payment, generous seller concessions, gift funds for entire down payment.

**Cons:** Permanent MIP (if <10% down), upfront MIP adds to loan balance, stricter property standards, appraisal sticks for 120 days, condo restrictions.

## 4. VA Loans — Detail

**Backed by:** Department of Veterans Affairs. Government-guaranteed.

**Eligibility:** Active-duty military, veterans (with qualifying service), National Guard/Reserve members (with qualifying service), and surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected disability.

**Key Features:**
- 0% down payment -- no down payment required at any price point
- No PMI, no mortgage insurance of any kind
- VA funding fee: 1.25% (first use with down payment) to 3.3% (subsequent use, no down payment). Waived for disabled veterans and surviving spouses.
- Funding fee can be financed into the loan
- No loan limit for borrowers with full entitlement (since Jan 2020)
- Residual income test (unique to VA): after all debts and expenses, the borrower must have sufficient remaining income by family size and region
- Interest rates are typically 0.25-0.5% lower than conventional

**What Agents Should Know:**
- VA Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs) are real: safe, structurally sound, sanitary. Specific requirements include adequate roofing, no lead paint hazards (pre-1978), functioning mechanical systems, adequate crawl space access, and no termite damage. The VA appraiser also assesses wood-destroying insect risk in applicable areas.
- VA appraisals must be ordered through the VA portal, not directly by the lender -- this can add 1-2 weeks in high-demand markets
- The VA appraisal is the most common friction point: it tends to be slightly more conservative on value and stricter on property condition than conventional
- "Entitlement" determines how much the VA will guarantee. Most veterans with full entitlement can purchase at any price with 0% down. Borrowers with partial entitlement (e.g., existing VA loan) may have limits.
- VA loans are assumable with VA approval -- a powerful feature when the existing rate is below market rates

**Post-Settlement Critical Note:**
- VA buyers CANNOT finance buyer agent fees into the VA loan
- VA buyers CANNOT have the buyer agent fee added to the loan amount
- If the seller does not pay the buyer agent fee, the VA buyer must pay from personal funds at or before closing
- This can significantly impact VA buyer cash needs and should be addressed early in the process

**Pros:** 0% down, no PMI, lowest rates, no loan limit (full entitlement), assumable, generous DTI flexibility via residual income.

**Cons:** VA funding fee (unless exempt), stricter appraisal (MPRs), slower appraisal process, cannot finance buyer agent fees post-settlement, property must be primary residence.

## 5. USDA Loans — Detail

**Backed by:** USDA Rural Development. Government-guaranteed.

**Eligibility:** Property must be in a USDA-eligible rural or suburban area (check eligibility maps at eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov). Household income cannot exceed 115% of area median income.

**Key Features:**
- 0% down payment
- Upfront guarantee fee: 1% of loan amount (can be financed)
- Annual fee: 0.35% of outstanding balance
- Income limits apply to the ENTIRE household, not just borrowers on the loan
- Property must be in an eligible geographic area
- Competitive interest rates (often comparable to VA)
- No loan limit, but borrower must demonstrate ability to repay

**What Agents Should Know:**
- Geographic eligibility is broader than most agents think: many suburban areas qualify, not just farms and ranches. Check the USDA eligibility map before assuming a property does not qualify.
- Income limits count ALL adult household members, even those not on the loan. A married couple buying together where one spouse has a high-earning adult child living with them may exceed the household income limit.
- USDA loans take longer to close (45-60 days is common) because USDA must issue a conditional commitment after the lender's underwriting
- Property must be owner-occupied and cannot be income-producing (no hobby farms with revenue, no home businesses generating significant income from the property)
- The 0.35% annual fee is lower than FHA MIP (0.55%) and is not permanent -- it falls off when LTV reaches 80% or after a specified period depending on the guarantee type

**Pros:** 0% down, lowest mortgage insurance cost, competitive rates, no stated loan limit, broader geographic eligibility than expected.

**Cons:** Geographic restrictions, household income limits, slower closing, limited to primary residence, property cannot be income-producing, fewer lenders offer USDA.

## 6. Jumbo Loans — Detail

**Not government-backed.** Held in lender portfolio or sold to private investors.

**Key Features:**
- For loan amounts above the conforming limit ($766,550 in most areas, $1,149,825 in high-cost areas)
- Higher down payment: typically 10-20% (some lenders offer 10% with higher rates)
- Higher credit score: typically 700-720+ minimum; best pricing at 760+
- Stricter DTI: typically 38-43% maximum back-end
- Asset reserves required: 6-12 months of mortgage payments in liquid assets after closing
- Rates are typically 0.25-0.5% higher than conforming (though this spread narrows with excellent credit and high down payment)
- Some lenders may require two appraisals

**What Agents Should Know:**
- Jumbo underwriting is more manual and takes longer -- budget 45-60 days minimum
- Self-employed borrowers face additional scrutiny: expect 2 years of tax returns, P&L statements, and potentially a CPA letter
- Condo purchases in the jumbo range may require additional condo project review
- Some lenders offer "super conforming" or "high-balance" programs for amounts between the standard and high-cost limits -- these carry better terms than true jumbo
- ARM products (adjustable-rate mortgages) are more common in the jumbo space; buyers planning to move in 5-7 years may benefit from a 5/1 or 7/1 ARM

**Pros:** Only option for high-price properties, no mortgage insurance with 20%+ down, ARM options for short-term holders.

**Cons:** Higher down payment, stricter qualification, higher rates, longer closing, fewer lender options, asset reserve requirements.

## 7. Rate vs. APR Explained

**Interest Rate:** The annual cost of borrowing the principal, expressed as a percentage. This determines the monthly principal and interest payment.

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** The total annualized cost of the loan including the interest rate PLUS lender fees, mortgage insurance premiums, and certain closing costs. APR is always higher than the interest rate (unless the lender is paying credits to the borrower).

**Why It Matters for Agents:**
- APR is the true comparison tool when a buyer is evaluating loan offers from different lenders. Two lenders quoting the same rate may have very different APRs due to fee differences.
- A lender quoting a slightly lower rate but charging 2 points in origination fees may have a HIGHER APR than a lender quoting a higher rate with no points.
- The Loan Estimate (required by CFPB within 3 business days of application) shows both rate and APR -- agents should help buyers understand the difference.

**Example:**
- Lender A: 6.75% rate, 0.5 points ($2,000), $3,000 in fees = 7.05% APR
- Lender B: 6.875% rate, 0 points, $1,500 in fees = 7.02% APR
- Lender B has the higher rate but the lower APR -- it is the cheaper loan overall.

## 8. Mortgage Points & Buydown Mechanics

### Discount Points (Permanent Buydown)

- 1 point = 1% of the loan amount paid at closing
- Each point typically reduces the rate by approximately 0.25% (varies by lender and market)
- Breakeven period: the time it takes for monthly savings to recoup the upfront cost
- Typical breakeven: 4-6 years

**Example — $400,000 Loan:**
| Scenario | Rate | Points Cost | Monthly P&I | Monthly Savings | Breakeven |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| No points | 7.00% | $0 | $2,661 | — | — |
| 1 point | 6.75% | $4,000 | $2,594 | $67 | 60 months |
| 2 points | 6.50% | $8,000 | $2,528 | $133 | 60 months |

**Agent guidance:** Points make sense when the buyer plans to stay 7+ years. For buyers likely to sell or refinance in 3-5 years, points rarely pay off.

### Temporary Buydowns

Temporary buydowns reduce the rate for a set period (1-3 years), funded by a lump sum deposited in escrow.

**2-1 Buydown:**
- Year 1: rate reduced by 2%
- Year 2: rate reduced by 1%
- Year 3+: full note rate

**1-0 Buydown:**
- Year 1: rate reduced by 1%
- Year 2+: full note rate

**Example — $400,000 Loan at 7.00% Note Rate, 2-1 Buydown:**
| Year | Effective Rate | Monthly P&I | Savings vs. Full Rate |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 5.00% | $2,147 | $514/month |
| 2 | 6.00% | $2,398 | $263/month |
| 3+ | 7.00% | $2,661 | $0 |
| **Buydown cost** | | | **~$9,324** |

**Who pays:** Typically the seller (as a concession) or builder (as an incentive). Buyers can also fund their own buydown but this is less common.

**Why it matters:** In high-rate environments, a 2-1 buydown is often more impactful to the buyer than a price reduction. A $10,000 price reduction saves ~$50/month over the life of the loan. A $9,300 buydown saves $514/month in year one. If rates drop during the buydown period, the buyer can refinance and the remaining escrow funds may be refunded.

## 9. Down Payment Assistance Program Framework

### Overview

Down payment assistance (DPA) programs are offered by state housing finance agencies (HFAs), county and city governments, nonprofits, and some employers. They are dramatically underutilized because agents and lenders often do not mention them.

### Common DPA Program Types

| Type | Description | Repayment |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Grant** | Free money; no repayment required | None |
| **Forgivable loan** | Second lien forgiven after 5-10 years of occupancy | Forgiven if buyer stays |
| **Deferred-payment loan** | 0% interest second lien; repaid at sale or refinance | Due at sale/refi |
| **Low-interest second loan** | Below-market second mortgage | Monthly payments required |
| **Matched savings** | Program matches buyer savings (e.g., 3:1) | None |

### Typical Eligibility Requirements

- First-time buyer (most programs define this as not having owned a home in the past 3 years)
- Income limits (typically 80-120% of area median income)
- Purchase price limits
- Minimum credit score (often 620-660)
- Homebuyer education course completion required
- Property must be primary residence
- Must use an approved lender

### How to Find DPA Programs

1. **State Housing Finance Agency (HFA):** Every state has one. Start here. (Examples: CalHFA in California, TSAHC in Texas, VHDA in Virginia)
2. **Down Payment Resource (downpaymentresource.com):** National database searchable by zip code
3. **HUD.gov Housing Counseling:** Local HUD-approved counseling agencies know available programs
4. **Lender partners:** Good lenders track available DPA programs in their service area

### Agent Action Items

- Know the top 2-3 DPA programs in your market (state HFA programs at minimum)
- Mention DPA to every first-time buyer during consultation -- do not wait for them to ask
- Maintain a lender partner who is experienced with DPA programs (not all lenders participate)
- Factor DPA into affordability calculations: a $15,000 DPA grant can be the difference between a buyer who can purchase and one who cannot
- Understand that DPA can be combined with FHA, conventional, and sometimes VA loans

## 10. Post-Settlement Buyer Agent Fee Implications by Loan Type

Effective August 17, 2024, buyer agent compensation is no longer communicated through the MLS. Buyers may be responsible for paying their agent. How this interacts with loan programs is critical knowledge for agents.

### By Loan Type

| Loan Type | Can Buyer Agent Fee Be Financed? | Seller Concession for Agent Fee? | Key Considerations |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Conventional** | No — cannot be added to loan amount | Yes — within concession limits (3/6/9% based on LTV) | Most flexible; seller concessions can cover agent fee alongside closing costs |
| **FHA** | No — cannot be added to loan amount | Yes — within 6% concession limit | Generous 6% limit can often accommodate both closing costs and agent fee |
| **VA** | No — explicitly prohibited by VA guidelines | Yes — but within 4% seller concession limit (agent fee counts toward this) | VA 4% limit is tighter; large agent fees may not fit. VA buyers may need to pay from personal funds. |
| **USDA** | No — cannot be added to loan amount | Yes — within 6% concession limit | Similar to FHA treatment; 6% limit is usually sufficient |
| **Jumbo** | No — cannot be added to loan amount | Yes — within lender-specific limits (typically 3-6%) | Varies by lender; high price points mean percentage limits translate to larger dollar amounts |

### Practical Strategies for Agents

1. **Negotiate seller payment of buyer agent fee:** The most common solution. Include in the purchase agreement as a seller concession.
2. **Adjust the offer price:** If the seller is paying the agent fee, the offer price can be adjusted upward to offset it (subject to appraisal support).
3. **Buyer pays from personal funds:** Especially relevant for VA buyers where concession limits are tight. Must be disclosed and cannot come from loan proceeds.
4. **Split the fee:** Some agents negotiate a reduced fee when the buyer is cash-constrained, with the seller covering a portion and the buyer paying the remainder.
5. **Coordinate with the lender early:** Before writing the offer, confirm with the buyer's lender that the proposed compensation structure fits within concession limits and does not trigger any lender-specific restrictions.

## 11. Seller Concession Limits by Loan Type

| Loan Type | Down Payment | Max Seller Concession | What Counts Toward the Limit |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Conventional** | <10% | 3% of sale price | Closing costs, prepaids, discount points, buyer agent fee (if seller-paid) |
| **Conventional** | 10-25% | 6% of sale price | Same as above |
| **Conventional** | >25% | 9% of sale price | Same as above |
| **FHA** | Any | 6% of sale price | Closing costs, prepaids, discount points, temporary buydowns, buyer agent fee |
| **VA** | Any | 4% of sale price | Prepaids, temporary buydowns, buyer agent fee. NOTE: discount points, closing costs, and payoff of buyer debts are NOT included in the 4% calculation |
| **USDA** | Any | 6% of sale price | Closing costs, prepaids, discount points, buyer agent fee |
| **Jumbo** | Varies | 3-6% (lender-specific) | Varies by lender |

**Critical VA Note:** The VA's 4% concession limit calculates differently than other loan types. It includes seller-paid prepaids, temporary buydowns, and buyer agent fees, but EXCLUDES discount points and normal closing costs. This means the VA 4% limit is actually less restrictive than it first appears for closing costs, but MORE restrictive for agent fee concessions.

## 12. Common Financing Scenarios — Quick Reference

### Scenario: First-Time Buyer, Limited Funds, 680 Credit
- **Best options:** FHA (3.5% down) or conventional with DPA
- **Explore:** State HFA DPA programs for grant or forgivable loan
- **Watch for:** FHA permanent MIP vs. conventional PMI removability. Run both scenarios.

### Scenario: Veteran, First Home Purchase, Strong Credit
- **Best option:** VA loan (0% down, no PMI, best rates)
- **Explore:** Whether funding fee is waived (disability rating)
- **Watch for:** Post-settlement agent fee cannot be financed into VA loan; address early

### Scenario: Move-Up Buyer, 20%+ Equity from Sale
- **Best option:** Conventional (20%+ down, no PMI, best terms)
- **Explore:** Bridge loan if timing does not align with sale of current home
- **Watch for:** Contingent sale timeline, rate lock duration

### Scenario: Rural/Suburban Buyer, Moderate Income
- **Best option:** USDA (0% down, lowest mortgage insurance)
- **Explore:** Eligibility map to confirm property qualifies
- **Watch for:** Household income limits (all adults in household, not just borrowers), longer closing timeline

### Scenario: High-Price Market, $900K Purchase
- **Best option:** Jumbo loan (above conforming limit in most areas) or high-balance conforming (if in a high-cost county)
- **Explore:** Whether the county qualifies for high-balance conforming limits ($766,550-$1,149,825)
- **Watch for:** Higher down payment, asset reserve requirements, stricter DTI, potentially two appraisals

### Scenario: Buyer Wants Lower Payments in Year 1
- **Best option:** 2-1 temporary buydown funded by seller concession
- **Explore:** Whether seller is willing to contribute $8,000-$12,000 in concessions (more impactful than price reduction)
- **Watch for:** Seller concession limits by loan type; buyer must qualify at the full note rate, not the bought-down rate

### Scenario: Buyer Comparing Two Lender Offers
- **Key comparison:** APR (not just rate), total lender fees, rate lock terms, closing cost credits
- **Explore:** Ask both lenders for Loan Estimates on the same day for apples-to-apples comparison
- **Watch for:** "Teaser" quotes that do not include all fees; lock expiration dates; whether rate includes points
