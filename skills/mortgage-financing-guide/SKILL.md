# Mortgage & Financing Guide

Mortgage and financing expertise for real estate agents -- not loan origination. Agents who understand loan types, qualification thresholds, closing cost structures, down payment assistance programs, and rate mechanics serve their buyers dramatically better than agents who say "talk to your lender." This skill makes agents fluent in financing language so they can guide buyer expectations, recommend appropriate lender partners, structure competitive offers that align with the buyer's loan type, and advise sellers on financing-related terms in offers. Post-NAR settlement, financing literacy matters more than ever because buyer agent fees may need creative structuring alongside closing costs and seller concessions.

## Core Principles

1. **Agents inform, lenders originate.** This skill equips agents with financing literacy to serve clients and collaborate with lenders effectively. Agents must never quote rates, guarantee approval, or steer buyers toward specific loan products. Always defer specific qualification and rate questions to a licensed loan officer.
2. **Financing shapes the offer.** Loan type directly impacts offer competitiveness, contingency timelines, seller concession limits, appraisal requirements, and closing speed. An agent who understands these constraints writes stronger offers and sets better expectations.
3. **Down payment assistance is not a last resort -- it is a strategy.** DPA programs are dramatically underutilized because agents do not know they exist. Proactively presenting DPA options to qualifying buyers is a competitive advantage and a client service obligation.

### How to Respond to Mortgage & Financing Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Loan Type Selection & Comparison

Includes: which loan type is best, FHA vs. conventional, VA eligibility, USDA requirements, jumbo thresholds, loan type pros/cons, first-time buyer loan options.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the buyer profile: military status (VA), location (USDA eligibility), credit score range, down payment available, purchase price range, and whether they are a first-time buyer.
2. Present the relevant loan type options using the comparison data in `references/loan-type-comparison.md`. Typically narrow to 2-3 realistic options for the buyer's situation.
3. Explain the practical tradeoffs the agent should understand: PMI/MIP cost impact on monthly payment, property condition requirements (FHA/VA appraisal standards are stricter), seller concession limits by loan type, and closing timeline differences.
4. Emphasize that the agent's role is to understand these programs well enough to guide initial conversations and triage -- the lender makes the final recommendation and qualification determination.
5. Cross-reference `buyer-representation` for incorporating financing discussions into the buyer consultation, and `offer-writer` for structuring offers by loan type.

#### Category B: Pre-Approval, Qualification & Affordability

Includes: pre-approval vs. pre-qualification, how much can a buyer afford, DTI ratios, credit score requirements, what lenders look at, getting the buyer qualified, when pre-approval expires.

**Workflow:**
1. Clarify the critical distinction: pre-qualification is a rough estimate based on self-reported data; pre-approval involves verified income, assets, credit, and a conditional commitment from the lender. Agents should require pre-approval before serious property search.
2. Explain the key qualification factors agents should understand: debt-to-income ratio (front-end and back-end), credit score minimums by loan type, employment history requirements, asset reserves, and property type restrictions.
3. Discuss affordability framing: help agents translate the pre-approval amount into a realistic price range by factoring in monthly payment comfort, property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, and lifestyle budget. The maximum approval is not the target purchase price.
4. Address common qualification issues agents encounter: self-employed borrowers (2 years tax returns), job changes during escrow, large deposits that need sourcing, student loan DTI treatment, and co-borrower strategies.
5. Remind agents: never quote specific rates, never guarantee qualification, never recommend against getting professional lender guidance. The agent's job is to ensure the buyer starts with a qualified lender early in the process.

#### Category C: Down Payment, Closing Costs & Financial Structuring

Includes: how much does the buyer need, closing cost estimates, DPA programs, seller concessions, earnest money, prepaid items, cash-to-close calculation, down payment assistance, grants.

**Workflow:**
1. Walk through the cash-to-close framework: down payment + closing costs + prepaids + reserves - seller concessions - DPA credits = cash needed. Agents who understand this math can set buyer expectations accurately from the first consultation.
2. Provide closing cost benchmarks: typically 2-5% of purchase price for buyers, with variation by state, lender, and loan type. Break into categories -- lender fees (origination, points, underwriting), third-party fees (title, appraisal, survey, inspection), prepaid items (taxes, insurance, interest), and escrow setup.
3. Address down payment assistance proactively: most markets have state, county, or city DPA programs offering grants, forgivable loans, or deferred-payment second liens. Agents should know the major programs in their market and mention them to every first-time buyer. Refer agents to their state housing finance agency (HFA) website for current programs.
4. Explain seller concession limits by loan type (see `references/loan-type-comparison.md`) and how to use concessions strategically in offer structuring -- particularly for rate buydowns.
5. Cross-reference `offer-writer` for incorporating financial terms into competitive offers and `transaction-coordinator` for earnest money handling and closing cost timeline.

#### Category D: Interest Rates, Points & Buydowns

Includes: current rate environment, rate vs. APR, mortgage points, rate buydowns, 2-1 buydown, 1-0 buydown, temporary buydown, permanent buydown, rate lock timing, how rates affect buying power.

**Workflow:**
1. Explain the rate vs. APR distinction: the interest rate is the cost of borrowing; the APR includes the rate plus lender fees, PMI, and other costs, expressed as an annual percentage. APR is the true cost comparison tool. See `references/loan-type-comparison.md` for the detailed explanation.
2. Cover mortgage points: one point equals 1% of the loan amount and typically reduces the rate by 0.25%. The breakeven period is usually 4-6 years. Points make sense for buyers planning to stay long-term; they do not make sense for buyers who may move in 3-5 years.
3. Explain temporary buydowns as a negotiation tool: a 2-1 buydown reduces the rate by 2% in year one and 1% in year two, funded by the seller (or builder) as a closing cost concession. This is a powerful tool in high-rate environments because it lowers the buyer's initial payment without permanently altering the loan terms.
4. Cover rate lock mechanics: typical lock periods are 30-60 days, some lenders offer extended locks (90-120 days) for new construction. Locks expire if closing does not occur within the period. Float-down options allow the buyer to benefit if rates drop during the lock.
5. Provide the buying power framework: every 1% increase in interest rate reduces buying power by approximately 10%. This helps agents frame rate changes in terms buyers understand -- dollars and purchasing ability, not abstract percentages.

#### Category E: Post-Settlement Financing Considerations

Includes: buyer agent fee financing, VA fee restrictions, FHA concession limits, how buyers pay their agent, financing and buyer agency agreements, creative compensation structures.

**Workflow:**
1. Address the post-NAR settlement impact on financing: buyers may now be responsible for paying their agent's fee, which creates new financing considerations that did not exist before August 2024.
2. Cover loan-type-specific rules: VA buyers cannot finance buyer agent fees into the loan and must pay from their own funds or negotiate seller payment; FHA allows seller concessions up to 6% of the sale price (which can cover buyer agent fees as a concession); conventional loans allow seller concessions based on down payment amount (3-9%).
3. Explain the strategies agents use to handle buyer agent fees: seller concessions, listing price adjustments, buyer payment from funds, hybrid approaches, and earnest money credit structures (where permitted by state law and lender).
4. Emphasize that agents must work closely with their buyer's lender to ensure any compensation structure does not violate lender guidelines, appraisal requirements, or anti-inducement rules.
5. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for the broader fee conversation framework and `compliance-navigator` for regulatory guardrails on compensation structures.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Loan Type Quick Reference

See `references/loan-type-comparison.md` for full comparison tables. Summary:

| Loan Type | Min Down | PMI/MIP | Key Feature |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Conventional | 3-5% | PMI if <20%, removable | Most flexible, fewest property restrictions |
| FHA | 3.5% | MIP for life (if <10% down) | Lower credit thresholds, higher DTI allowed |
| VA | 0% | No PMI | Military only, funding fee required, strict appraisal |
| USDA | 0% | Guarantee fee | Rural areas, income limits, geographic restrictions |
| Jumbo | 10-20% | Varies | Above conforming limit, stricter qualification |

### Conforming Loan Limits (2025)

- Standard: $766,550 (single-family, most counties)
- High-cost areas: up to $1,149,825 (Alaska, Hawaii, high-cost mainland counties)
- These limits adjust annually based on FHFA home price data

### Key Qualification Metrics

- **DTI (Debt-to-Income):** Front-end (housing costs / gross income) and back-end (all debts / gross income). Conventional max typically 45-50% back-end; FHA allows up to 57% with compensating factors; VA has no hard DTI cap but uses residual income.
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value):** Loan amount / appraised value. Determines PMI requirements and pricing. 80% LTV = no PMI on conventional.
- **Credit score minimums:** Conventional 620+, FHA 580+ (3.5% down) or 500-579 (10% down), VA no minimum (most lenders require 620+), USDA 640+.

### Closing Cost Breakdown (Buyer)

| Category | Typical Range | Examples |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Lender fees | 0.5-1.5% | Origination, underwriting, processing |
| Title/escrow | 0.5-1.0% | Title search, title insurance, escrow/closing fee |
| Appraisal | $400-$800 | Lender-ordered, varies by property type |
| Prepaid items | 1.0-2.0% | Property tax escrow, homeowner's insurance, prepaid interest |
| Recording/government | $200-$500 | Deed recording, transfer taxes (varies by state) |
| **Total typical** | **2-5%** | Higher in attorney-close states, lower in escrow states |

### Buying Power Impact of Rate Changes

| Rate | Monthly P&I on $400K Loan | Buying Power vs. 6% |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 5.0% | $2,147 | +11% more home |
| 5.5% | $2,271 | +5% more home |
| 6.0% | $2,398 | Baseline |
| 6.5% | $2,528 | -5% less home |
| 7.0% | $2,661 | -10% less home |
| 7.5% | $2,796 | -15% less home |

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents:** Practical and empowering. Give them the knowledge to hold intelligent financing conversations with clients and lenders. They do not need to become loan officers -- they need enough fluency to set buyer expectations, recognize red flags, and ask the right questions.

**To team leaders:** Systems-focused. Help them build financing education into their buyer consultation process, create lender partner evaluation criteria, and ensure every team member can discuss financing basics confidently with clients.

**To broker/owners:** Compliance-aware and strategic. Frame financing literacy as risk mitigation (agents giving bad financing advice creates liability) and competitive advantage (agents who understand financing close more deals).

**To new agents:** Encouraging and structured. Financing feels overwhelming at first. Break it into digestible pieces: start with the five loan types, then closing costs, then rates and points. They do not need to master everything before their first buyer -- they need to know enough to ask smart questions and defer the rest to the lender.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: First-Time Buyer Does Not Know What They Can Afford

**User says:** "My buyer has no idea how much they can afford. They make about $85K household income with minimal debt. Where do I start?"

**Actions:**
1. Start with the pre-approval recommendation: the buyer needs to speak with a lender before any serious property search. Agents should have 2-3 vetted lender partners to refer.
2. Provide a rough affordability framework the agent can use in the initial consultation: at $85K income with minimal debt, a back-end DTI of 40-43% allows roughly $2,800-$3,000/month total housing payment (PITI). At current rates, that supports a purchase price range of roughly $350-$425K depending on taxes, insurance, HOA, and down payment.
3. Discuss loan type options: with good credit, conventional at 5% down is likely optimal. If credit is below 700, FHA at 3.5% may offer better pricing. If the buyer is a veteran, VA at 0% down is the clear winner.
4. Proactively mention DPA programs: if this is a first-time buyer (most state programs define this as not owning a home in the past 3 years), check the state HFA for down payment grants or forgivable loans that could reduce cash-to-close significantly.
5. Remind the agent that maximum pre-approval is not the target price. Help the buyer think about monthly payment comfort, not maximum loan amount. Cross-reference `buyer-representation` for the full needs analysis framework.

### Scenario 2: Agent Needs to Explain Why the VA Offer Is Competitive

**User says:** "My listing has a VA offer and the seller is nervous about it. They think VA loans fall through more often. How do I advise my seller?"

**Actions:**
1. Address the misconception directly: VA loans do not fall through at materially higher rates than conventional loans. The concern typically centers on the VA appraisal, which has slightly stricter property condition requirements (functioning systems, no health/safety hazards, adequate roof life).
2. Explain what the seller should actually evaluate: the buyer's pre-approval strength, earnest money amount, contingency terms, and closing timeline matter more than the loan type. A well-qualified VA buyer with strong reserves is a stronger buyer than a conventional buyer stretched to their max DTI.
3. Cover the VA appraisal reality: if the home is in good condition with no major health/safety issues, the VA appraisal is unlikely to cause problems. Homes with deferred maintenance, peeling paint (pre-1978 homes), or non-functional systems may trigger VA-specific requirements.
4. Note the post-settlement consideration: VA buyers cannot finance buyer agent fees into the loan. If the seller is not offering buyer agent compensation, the VA buyer must pay their agent from their own funds, which may reduce their cash reserves. This is a genuine financial consideration the listing agent should understand.
5. Cross-reference `negotiation-strategy` for evaluating competing offers and `listing-services` for advising sellers on offer evaluation.

### Scenario 3: Buyer Wants to Use a 2-1 Buydown

**User says:** "My buyer's lender mentioned a 2-1 buydown. I honestly don't know how it works. Can you explain it so I can discuss it with my client and use it in our offer?"

**Actions:**
1. Explain the mechanics: a 2-1 temporary buydown reduces the interest rate by 2% in year one and 1% in year two, returning to the full note rate in year three. Example: on a 7% note rate with a $400K loan, year one payment is calculated at 5% ($2,147/mo), year two at 6% ($2,398/mo), and year three onward at 7% ($2,661/mo).
2. Explain the funding: the rate reduction is funded by a lump sum deposited into an escrow account at closing. The cost is approximately equal to the total payment reduction over the two years. For the example above, the buydown costs roughly $7,600-$8,000. This can be paid by the seller as a concession, by the builder as an incentive, or by the buyer.
3. Frame the strategic value: in a high-rate environment, a 2-1 buydown gives the buyer immediate payment relief and the opportunity to refinance if rates drop during the buydown period. It makes a higher-priced offer more palatable to the buyer because the initial payments are lower.
4. Explain how to use it in offers: structure the offer with a seller concession specifically allocated to the buydown fund. For example, "Seller to contribute $8,000 toward a 2-1 temporary rate buydown." This is more impactful to the buyer than a generic closing cost credit because it reduces the monthly payment for two years.
5. Note the comparison to price reduction: a $10,000 price reduction saves the buyer approximately $50/month on a 30-year mortgage. An $8,000 buydown saves $250-$500/month in years one and two. The buydown delivers more immediate value to the buyer, which makes it a powerful negotiation tool.

### Scenario 4: Agent Confused About PMI vs. MIP

**User says:** "What's the difference between PMI and MIP? My buyer is putting 5% down and I want to explain their options."

**Actions:**
1. Define both: PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) applies to conventional loans when the down payment is below 20%. MIP (Mortgage Insurance Premium) applies to FHA loans regardless of down payment. Both protect the lender against default -- not the borrower.
2. Explain the key difference that matters: PMI on conventional loans is removable once the borrower reaches 20% equity (by request at 80% LTV or automatically at 78% LTV). FHA MIP is permanent for the life of the loan if the buyer puts less than 10% down. If they put 10%+ down, MIP drops off after 11 years.
3. Provide cost context: PMI typically runs 0.5-1.5% of the loan amount annually, depending on credit score and LTV. FHA MIP has an upfront premium of 1.75% of the loan (can be financed) plus an annual premium of 0.55% for most borrowers.
4. Walk through the math for a $400K purchase at 5% down: conventional PMI might cost $150-$250/month and drops off in 5-8 years as equity builds. FHA MIP costs $183/month (annual) plus the upfront premium -- and never drops off unless they put 10%+ down or refinance to conventional later.
5. Give the practical recommendation the agent can share: if the buyer has a 700+ credit score and 5% down, conventional with PMI is almost always cheaper long-term than FHA with MIP, because the PMI goes away. If the buyer has a 640-680 credit score, FHA may offer better rate pricing despite the permanent MIP. The lender should run both scenarios side by side.

### Scenario 5: Post-Settlement Question About How the Buyer Pays Their Agent

**User says:** "My buyer is using an FHA loan. Can the seller concession cover my fee as the buyer's agent? How does this work now?"

**Actions:**
1. Explain the current landscape: post-August 2024, buyer agent compensation is no longer communicated through the MLS. Buyers may need to pay their agent directly, or the seller may agree to contribute toward buyer agent compensation as part of the transaction.
2. Cover FHA-specific rules: FHA allows seller concessions up to 6% of the sale price. This 6% can cover closing costs, prepaids, rate buydowns, AND buyer agent compensation if structured properly. The buyer agent fee is treated as a seller concession within this limit.
3. Provide the math: on a $350K FHA purchase, the 6% concession limit is $21,000. If closing costs and prepaids total $12,000 and the buyer agent fee is $8,750 (2.5%), the total of $20,750 fits within the 6% cap.
4. Flag the critical consideration: the total concessions cannot exceed the 6% limit. If the concessions push the total above 6%, the lender will not approve the structure. The agent, buyer, and lender must coordinate the numbers before submitting the offer.
5. Note the contrast with other loan types: VA buyers cannot finance agent fees at all and must pay from personal funds. Conventional concession limits depend on down payment (3% for <10% down, 6% for 10-25% down, 9% for >25% down). Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for the broader buyer agent compensation framework.

## Important Caveats

- **This skill does not provide lending advice.** Agents must not quote rates, guarantee qualification, pre-qualify buyers, or recommend specific loan products. Always defer to a licensed loan originator for buyer-specific guidance.
- **State-specific variations exist.** Transfer taxes, closing cost customs (who pays what), attorney requirements, recording fees, and DPA program availability vary significantly by state. Always verify local conventions.
- **Rates and limits change.** Conforming loan limits, FHA loan limits, PMI rates, and MIP rates are updated annually. DPA program availability changes frequently. Always confirm current figures with the lender.
- **Post-settlement rules are evolving.** The treatment of buyer agent fees in lending (VA restrictions, FHA concession treatment, conventional guidelines) may change as lenders and regulators adapt. Monitor Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA guidance updates.
- **Lender selection matters.** Agents should evaluate lender partners on closing rate, on-time performance, communication quality, and product range -- not just personal relationship or referral fee arrangements. RESPA prohibits referral fees between agents and lenders.
- **Down payment assistance eligibility changes.** Programs have funding caps, income limits, and geographic restrictions that change frequently. Always verify current availability with the state HFA or the lender before telling a buyer they qualify.
