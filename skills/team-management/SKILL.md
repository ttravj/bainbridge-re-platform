# Team Management

The operational backbone skill for anyone who has moved beyond solo production into leading people. The solo-to-team transition is the highest-stakes inflection point in a real estate career -- more agents fail at it than succeed, and the failures are expensive. Done right, a team provides leverage, scale, and the freedom to focus on the highest-value activities. Done wrong, it creates overhead, management headaches, liability, and a team leader who earns less than they did alone. This skill covers the full spectrum: the decision to build a team, hiring order, role definitions, compensation design, team economics modeling, recruiting, retention, culture, accountability, and brokerage-level operations including P&L management, trust accounts, compliance supervision, and agent performance tracking. It serves solo agents evaluating whether a team makes sense, team leaders managing existing teams, broker/owners running brokerages, and new agents trying to understand the team structures they are joining.

## Core Principles

1. **Hire for a problem, not a milestone.** Teams fail when agents hire because they think they "should" at a certain production level rather than because a specific, identified bottleneck demands it. Every hire must solve a named problem: "I am losing 18 hours per transaction to admin" justifies a TC. "I have more buyer leads than I can physically serve" justifies a buyer's agent. "I want to feel like a team leader" justifies nothing.
2. **Revenue before headcount.** Never add a team member unless the math works on paper first and the lead flow exists to support them. A buyer's agent with no leads is an expense, not leverage. Every hire must have a clear path to generating revenue that exceeds their fully loaded cost within 90 days -- or the hire is premature.
3. **The leader's job is rainmaking, not managing.** The entire purpose of a team is to free the leader to do what generates the most revenue: listing appointments, lead generation, and high-level client relationships. If building a team turns a $400K-GCI rainmaker into a $200K-GCI manager, the team destroyed value. Every operational decision should be evaluated against the question: "Does this keep the leader in the rainmaker seat?"

### How to Respond to Team Building & Management Queries

When a user asks a question in this domain, identify the category and follow the appropriate workflow:

#### Category A: Should I Build a Team / When to Hire

Includes: should I build a team, am I ready for a team, when to hire, is it time to add people, I'm maxed out, I can't handle more business, do I need a team.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask for (or estimate from context): annual transaction count, GCI, how they spend their time (percentage on prospecting/appointments vs. admin vs. showing vs. management), current support (any TC, VA, or assistant), and what is limiting their growth (time, leads, skill, or capacity).
2. Apply the readiness checklist. Team readiness requires ALL of these: (a) consistent production of 30-40+ transactions/year for at least one full year, (b) more inbound leads or opportunities than the agent can personally serve, (c) willingness to accept lower per-deal income in exchange for higher total volume, (d) systems and processes documented enough to train someone else, (e) financial reserves to cover 3-6 months of a new hire's cost if ramp-up is slow.
3. If the agent is at 15-25 transactions and feeling overwhelmed, the answer is almost always leverage, not a team. Prescribe a TC first (per-file or salaried), then a virtual assistant for admin. This alone can reclaim 500+ hours/year and support growth to 35-45 transactions before a team is needed. Cross-reference `business-planner` for the business model progression framework.
4. If the agent meets the readiness criteria, walk through the hiring order (see Key Domain Knowledge) and model the first hire's economics before recommending it.
5. Be direct about the risks: 60-70% of first-year teams lose money or break even. The most common cause is hiring before lead flow can support the new person, followed by no training system and unrealistic production expectations.

#### Category B: Who to Hire / Role Definitions / Hiring Order

Includes: who should I hire first, team roles, what does an ISA do, should I hire a TC, do I need a showing agent, buyer's agent vs showing agent, listing specialist, operations manager, hiring order.

**Workflow:**
1. Assess the agent's current bottleneck. The hiring order is dictated by where the leader is losing the most time on non-rainmaking activities.
2. Present the standard hiring sequence and explain why each role comes when it does (see Key Domain Knowledge for the full role breakdown):
   - **Hire 1: Transaction Coordinator.** Reclaims 16-18 hours per transaction. At 30 transactions/year, that is 480-540 hours returned to Dollar-Productive Activities. Cost: $35K-$55K salary or $350-$500 per file. Almost always the right first hire.
   - **Hire 2: ISA or Showing Agent.** ISA if the bottleneck is lead conversion (leads coming in but not being called quickly or consistently). Showing agent if the bottleneck is buyer showings consuming the leader's appointment time.
   - **Hire 3: Buyer's Agent.** Only after lead flow can support another producing agent. A buyer's agent needs 3-5 leads per week minimum to ramp. If the team cannot provide that, the hire will fail.
   - **Hire 4+: Additional agents, listing specialist, marketing coordinator, ops manager.** These come as volume justifies each role.
3. For each role discussed, provide the compensation framework (salary, split, hybrid), typical production expectations, and the break-even timeline.
4. If the user asks about a specific role, go deep on that role: job description, compensation range, where to find candidates, interview questions, 90-day onboarding plan, and KPIs.

#### Category C: Compensation Structures / Team Splits

Includes: team splits, what to pay a buyer's agent, TC compensation, ISA pay, team commission structure, how to structure compensation, lead source splits, is my split fair to my agents.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the role and the lead source. Compensation must differentiate between team-generated leads (the leader or team paid for them) and agent-generated leads (the agent found them through their own SOI or prospecting).
2. Present the compensation framework by role (see Key Domain Knowledge). The key principle: the party that generates the lead earns a larger share of the commission.
3. Model the economics for both the team leader and the team member. If a buyer's agent on a 50/50 split closes 15 deals at $8K average GCI, the agent earns $60K and the leader earns $60K. But the leader must subtract lead cost ($500-$2,000/lead x the leads that produced those 15 closings), technology ($200-$500/month), training time, and management overhead. Net to the leader might be $30K-$40K. Is that profitable? Only the math can answer.
4. Address the most common compensation mistake: flat splits that do not account for lead source. An agent who closes a deal from a team-provided lead (cost: $500-$3,000 in marketing spend) should not receive the same split as an agent who brings their own client. Standard: team leads at 50/50 or 40/60 (agent/leader), self-generated leads at 70/30 or 80/20.
5. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for broader commission economics and `financial-performance` for modeling the team P&L.

#### Category D: Recruiting & Retention

Includes: how to recruit agents, agent retention, why agents leave, how to keep my agents, recruiting strategy, brokerage recruiting, what agents look for in a team or brokerage, agent attrition.

**Workflow:**
1. For recruiting: ask about the team or brokerage size, current value proposition, and what type of agent they want to attract (new, experienced, top producer).
2. Present the recruiting framework. Recruiting is selling -- the "product" is the team or brokerage opportunity. The value proposition must answer: What do agents get here that they cannot get elsewhere? The four pillars of a recruiting pitch: (a) economics (split, cap, fees, leads), (b) support (training, mentorship, TC, technology), (c) culture (accountability, collaboration, community), (d) growth path (leadership opportunities, income trajectory).
3. For experienced agent recruiting, emphasize that top producers are recruited by everyone. The differentiator is rarely the split -- it is the infrastructure, culture, and growth opportunity. Lead with "what problem do you have that we solve?" not "our split is better."
4. For retention: diagnose why agents leave. The top five reasons agents leave teams or brokerages: (a) they outgrew the value provided and the split no longer makes sense, (b) they feel unsupported or undervalued, (c) they were promised leads or training that did not materialize, (d) culture is toxic or nonexistent, (e) a better economic offer from a competitor. The fix for each is different -- some require split adjustment, some require cultural change, some require better systems.
5. Provide the retention economics: replacing an agent costs $5K-$15K+ (recruiting time, onboarding, lost production during transition, relationship disruption). Retention is almost always cheaper than recruiting. Invest in the agents you have before chasing new ones.
6. Cross-reference `brokerage-evaluator` for understanding what agents evaluate when choosing a team or brokerage, and `onboarding-training` for structured onboarding programs.

#### Category E: Brokerage Operations / P&L / Compliance

Includes: running a brokerage, brokerage P&L, brokerage profitability, trust accounts, compliance management, agent supervision, brokerage overhead, brokerage management.

**Workflow:**
1. For P&L questions: walk through the brokerage revenue model (company dollar from agent splits + per-transaction fees + desk/technology fees + franchise royalties if applicable) versus expenses (office/space, staff, technology platform, E&O coverage, marketing/recruiting, compliance systems, accounting).
2. Present the brokerage margin reality: most brokerages operate on 5-15% net margins. The math is thin. Revenue depends on agent count and per-agent production, both of which fluctuate. A brokerage with 30 agents averaging 8 transactions at $400K average sale price and a 10% company dollar generates roughly $288K in gross revenue -- out of which all overhead must be covered.
3. For trust account questions: emphasize that trust account management is the single highest regulatory risk in brokerage operations. Mishandling escrow funds can result in license revocation, fines, and personal liability. Rules vary by state but universally require: separate trust accounts, detailed transaction-level accounting, regular reconciliation (monthly at minimum), no commingling of personal and trust funds. Recommend a dedicated trust accounting system and periodic audits.
4. For compliance and supervision: the supervising broker is legally responsible for agent conduct. This means reviewing transaction files, ensuring disclosure compliance, monitoring advertising (including social media), maintaining records per state retention requirements, and enforcing fair housing standards. Cross-reference `compliance-navigator` for regulatory requirements and `fair-housing-compliance` for advertising standards.
5. For brokerage profitability improvement: the three levers are agent count (recruiting), per-agent production (training and support), and cost control (technology efficiency, right-sizing office space). Most struggling brokerages are weak on at least two of these.

## Key Domain Knowledge

### Team Role Definitions

| Role | Function | Compensation Model | Typical Cost/Earnings | Hire When |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Transaction Coordinator** | Contract-to-close management: deadlines, documents, lender/title coordination | Salary or per-file fee | $35K-$55K salary or $350-$500/file | 20-30+ transactions/year, admin consuming >40% of leader's time |
| **Inside Sales Agent (ISA)** | Inbound/outbound lead qualification, appointment setting | Salary ($30K-$45K) + bonus per appointment set or deal closed ($250-$1,000) | $40K-$70K total | Lead flow exceeds leader's ability to follow up within 5 minutes |
| **Showing Agent** | Licensed agent who shows properties on behalf of team | Per-showing fee ($50-$100) or referral fee (25-35% of buy-side commission) | Varies by activity | Leader's showing schedule conflicts with listing appointments |
| **Buyer's Agent** | Full buyer representation from consultation through closing | Commission split: 50/50 on team leads, 70/30-80/20 on self-generated | $50K-$120K depending on production | Consistent lead overflow that the leader cannot personally serve |
| **Listing Specialist** | Dedicated listing agent (listing presentations, seller management, pricing) | Commission split: 40/60 to 50/50 (agent/leader) on team leads | $60K-$150K+ | Team volume exceeds 50+ transactions and leader wants to step back from some listings |
| **Marketing Coordinator** | Content creation, social media, listing marketing, brand management | Salary | $35K-$55K | When marketing tasks consume 10+ hours/week of the leader's or agents' time |
| **Operations Manager** | Team administration, agent onboarding, systems management, compliance | Salary | $45K-$70K | Team reaches 8+ agents or 80+ transactions where coordination complexity demands a dedicated role |

### Hiring Order Framework

The order is not arbitrary. Each hire removes a specific constraint:

1. **TC first** -- removes admin burden. Leader reclaims time for DPAs. Cost is low, ROI is immediate. Almost never wrong.
2. **ISA or showing agent** -- removes lead leakage (ISA) or showing time drain (showing agent). Choose based on which bottleneck is more costly.
3. **Buyer's agent** -- removes capacity ceiling. Only works if lead flow exists. A buyer's agent without leads is the most common expensive mistake in team building.
4. **Second buyer's agent / listing specialist** -- adds capacity and specialization. The team is now a production machine, not a solo agent with helpers.
5. **Marketing coordinator / ops manager** -- adds infrastructure. The team is now a business with dedicated operational support.

### Team Compensation Frameworks

**Split-Based Compensation (Buyer's Agents, Listing Specialists):**

| Lead Source | Typical Split (Agent/Leader) | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Team-generated lead (paid advertising, team website, ISA-set) | 50/50 to 40/60 | Team paid for the lead. Cost of acquisition justifies larger team share. |
| Agent-generated lead (agent's SOI, open house, personal prospecting) | 70/30 to 80/20 | Agent sourced the lead. Team provides brand, TC, systems. |
| Referral from team leader's network | 50/50 | Leader relationship generated the opportunity. |
| Walk-in / sign call / unattributed | 50/50 | Default to team-generated since team marketing created the brand awareness. |

**Salary + Bonus (ISAs):**

| Component | Range | Benchmark |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Base salary | $30,000-$45,000 | Must cover living expenses -- ISA turnover is high when base is too low |
| Per-appointment bonus | $50-$150 | Paid when the appointment is kept, not just set |
| Per-closing bonus | $250-$1,000 | Paid when a lead the ISA set closes. Aligns long-term incentives. |
| Target total compensation | $45,000-$70,000 | Competitive with entry-level sales roles in the market |

### Team P&L Framework

Every team should model their P&L monthly. Here is the framework:

| Line | Item | Typical Range |
|------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Total team GCI | Sum of all team member closings |
| 2 | Less: Agent splits paid | 40-60% of GCI depending on split structure and lead mix |
| 3 | Less: Brokerage split/fees on team GCI | 15-30% (team leader pays brokerage on total team production) |
| 4 | **Gross team margin** | 15-40% of total team GCI |
| 5 | Less: TC salary/fees | $35K-$55K/year or per-file |
| 6 | Less: ISA salary + bonuses | $45K-$70K/year |
| 7 | Less: Lead generation spend | $2K-$15K/month |
| 8 | Less: Technology (CRM, tools, subscriptions) | $500-$2,000/month |
| 9 | Less: Marketing and advertising | $1K-$5K/month |
| 10 | Less: Office/desk costs (if applicable) | $0-$3K/month |
| 11 | Less: Training and coaching | $500-$2K/month |
| 12 | **Net team income to leader** | Varies widely -- target 20-35% of total team GCI |

**Critical insight:** Many team leaders discover that their net income as a team leader is lower than their net income as a high-producing solo agent. This is normal in year one. If it persists beyond year two, the team model needs restructuring or the leader needs to return to high-production solo work with leverage.

### Brokerage P&L Framework

| Revenue Source | Typical Amount |
|----------------|---------------|
| Company dollar (commission splits) | 60-80% of brokerage revenue |
| Per-transaction fees | 10-20% of revenue |
| Monthly desk/tech fees | 5-15% of revenue |
| Other (training, referral fees, ancillary) | 0-10% of revenue |

| Expense Category | Typical % of Revenue |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Office/space | 15-25% |
| Staff (non-agent) | 15-25% |
| Technology platform | 5-10% |
| E&O and insurance | 3-5% |
| Marketing and recruiting | 5-15% |
| Franchise fees (if applicable) | 5-8% |
| Other overhead | 5-10% |
| **Net margin** | **5-15%** |

### IC vs. Employee Classification

This is a legal minefield that team leaders and brokers must navigate carefully:

**Independent Contractor (IC):** The standard classification for real estate agents. The principal controls the result but not the method. ICs set their own schedules, provide their own tools (largely), and are paid by commission. IRS uses a multi-factor test; the three key categories are behavioral control, financial control, and relationship type.

**Employee:** Subject to payroll taxes, benefits obligations, workers' comp, and employment law. TCs, ISAs, and marketing coordinators are frequently misclassified as ICs when they should be employees (set schedule, provided tools, ongoing relationship, controlled methods).

**The risk:** Misclassification can trigger back taxes, penalties, and legal liability. If you control when, where, and how someone works, they are likely an employee regardless of what the contract says. State laws vary -- California (AB5), Massachusetts, and New Jersey have stricter classification tests. Always consult an employment attorney for your state.

### Team Culture & Accountability Systems

**Daily/Weekly Rhythms:**
- **Daily huddle (10-15 minutes):** Wins from yesterday, top 3 priorities today, blockers. Standing meeting, no sitting.
- **Weekly team meeting (60 minutes):** KPI review, pipeline review, training topic, recognition.
- **Monthly 1:1 (30-45 minutes per agent):** Production review against goals, coaching, career development, satisfaction check.
- **Quarterly planning (half-day):** Goal setting, pipeline forecasting, team P&L review, strategy adjustments.

**KPIs to Track by Role:**

| Role | Key KPIs |
|------|----------|
| Buyer's Agent | Leads worked, appointments set, showings, offers written, contracts, closings, GCI |
| ISA | Calls made, contacts reached, appointments set, appointment-kept rate, conversion to closing |
| TC | Files managed, on-time closing rate, error rate, client satisfaction |
| Listing Specialist | Listing appointments, listings taken, list-to-sale ratio, DOM, seller satisfaction |
| Team overall | Total GCI, transactions, lead conversion rate, client satisfaction, agent retention |

### Recruiting Fundamentals

**Where to find agents:**
- Your own brokerage's agent roster (internal team recruiting)
- Real estate schools and pre-license courses (new agents)
- Open houses and industry events (networking)
- Social media (LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Agent-to-agent referrals
- MLS activity tracking (identify active agents in your market)

**The recruiting conversation framework:**
1. **Discovery:** What does their business look like? What do they want it to look like? What is holding them back?
2. **Pain point identification:** Where is the gap between where they are and where they want to be?
3. **Value alignment:** How does your team/brokerage specifically address that gap?
4. **Economics:** Model their take-home on your structure vs. their current structure.
5. **Social proof:** Testimonials, agent success stories, team performance data.
6. **Next step:** Shadow day, ride-along, or trial period -- low-commitment entry point.

### Industry Standards & References

## Tone & Style by Audience

**To solo agents considering a team:** Cautious and math-driven. Most solo agents romanticize team building. They see the top producer with 10 agents and think "that's the next step." They do not see the overhead, the management headaches, the agents who quit after 3 months, or the net income that might be lower than their solo production. Show them the math first. If the math works and they meet the readiness criteria, support the decision. If they are at 20 transactions and want to hire a buyer's agent because they feel busy, prescribe a TC and better time blocking instead.

**To team leaders:** Operational and profit-focused. They are past the "should I?" question and into "how do I make this work better?" Speak in unit economics: cost per agent seat, revenue per team member, lead cost per closing, team margin per transaction. Help them diagnose whether underperformance is a people problem (wrong hires, no training), a leads problem (not enough flow to support the team), or a systems problem (no accountability, no CRM discipline, no standard operating procedures). Every recommendation should improve margin, retention, or both.

**To broker/owners:** Strategic and enterprise-level. They manage agents who manage clients -- two layers of leadership complexity. Speak to recruiting pipeline, retention rates, per-agent profitability, compliance risk, and brokerage P&L. They need frameworks that scale across 20, 50, or 200 agents. Help them evaluate whether their value proposition justifies their commission structure, whether their technology stack supports agent productivity, and whether their culture retains agents or drives them to competitors. Cross-reference `brokerage-evaluator` for the agent perspective on what they evaluate.

**To new agents on teams:** Practical and career-oriented. They need to understand their compensation structure, what is expected of them, how to maximize their income on the team's split, and when they might outgrow the team. Help them evaluate whether their team is investing in their development or simply using them as low-cost buyer coverage. A good team accelerates a career by 2-3 years. A bad team wastes 1-2 years and teaches bad habits.

## Common Scenarios & Examples

### Scenario 1: Solo Agent Ready to Build a Team

**User says:** "I closed 38 deals last year, GCI was $320K. I'm turning away business and working 60-hour weeks. Should I start building a team?"

**Actions:**
1. Confirm readiness: 38 transactions is well above the threshold. Turning away business means lead flow exceeds personal capacity -- the #1 prerequisite for a team.
2. Diagnose the current time allocation: ask how many hours per week on admin, showings, prospecting, and appointments. At 38 deals, they are likely spending 30-40% of time on non-DPA work.
3. Recommend the hiring sequence: TC first (if they do not have one) to reclaim 600+ hours/year. Then assess whether the overflow is buyer leads (hire buyer's agent) or lead follow-up (hire ISA). At 38 deals with active overflow, a buyer's agent is likely the second hire.
4. Model the first buyer's agent economics: if the new agent closes 12 deals from team leads at $8K average GCI on a 50/50 split, the leader earns $48K in team revenue. Subtract lead costs (~$10K-$15K to generate leads for 12 closings), technology (~$3K), and training time value (~$3K-$5K). Net to leader: $25K-$32K in year one. Meanwhile, the leader's personal production can increase because buyer showings are handled.
5. Set expectations: year one is break-even to modestly profitable for most teams. The payoff comes in years 2-3 as the buyer's agent ramps and the leader's personal production rebounds from reclaimed time.
6. Cross-reference `financial-performance` for modeling the team P&L impact on personal income and tax implications of payroll.

### Scenario 2: Team Leader with Underperforming Agent

**User says:** "I hired a buyer's agent six months ago. She's only closed 3 deals. I'm spending $2,500/month on leads for her. Should I let her go?"

**Actions:**
1. Gather context: what is the lead volume and quality? How many leads has the agent received? What is her contact rate, appointment rate, and conversion rate? Is she following the team's systems and scripts?
2. Diagnose the root cause -- there are three possibilities: (a) lead problem (insufficient volume or poor quality -- 3 closings from 10 leads is different from 3 closings from 100 leads), (b) skill problem (agent is not converting at acceptable rates -- check each conversion stage), (c) effort problem (agent is not working the leads promptly or consistently -- check CRM activity logs).
3. If lead problem: the fix is lead flow, not termination. At $2,500/month for 6 months ($15K total), how many leads did that generate? If fewer than 60-80, the cost per lead is too high or the source is underperforming. Cross-reference `lead-generation` for source evaluation.
4. If skill problem: the fix is training and coaching, not immediate termination. Put the agent on a 60-day performance improvement plan: specific activity targets (contacts per day, appointments per week), weekly coaching sessions, script practice, shadow appointments with the leader. Most skill gaps are fixable with structured coaching.
5. If effort problem: have the direct conversation. Review CRM data showing lead response times, call volume, and follow-up frequency. If the agent is not doing the work despite training and support, that is a fit issue. Set a 30-day final performance period with clear, measurable targets. If targets are not met, part ways professionally.
6. Calculate the sunk cost vs. replacement cost: you have invested $15K in leads plus training time. Recruiting and onboarding a replacement will cost $5K-$10K and take 2-3 months before the new agent is productive. If the current agent shows improvement trajectory, continued investment may yield better ROI than starting over.

### Scenario 3: Broker/Owner Struggling with Agent Retention

**User says:** "I've lost 8 agents in the past year to eXp and Real. My traditional 70/30 split can't compete. What do I do?"

**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge the market reality: cloud brokerages with lower splits and caps have fundamentally changed the competitive landscape. Competing on split alone against an 80/20 with a $16K cap is a losing proposition for a traditional brokerage.
2. Reframe the conversation: agents who leave purely for a better split were never loyal to the brokerage -- they were tolerating the split because switching felt hard. The real question is: what value does your brokerage provide that justifies a 70/30 split?
3. Conduct the value audit. List everything the brokerage provides: office space, technology, training, mentorship, leads, TC support, marketing tools, brand, compliance infrastructure, community. Estimate the replacement cost for each if the agent had to self-fund at a cloud brokerage. Cross-reference `brokerage-evaluator` for the agent-side perspective on this analysis.
4. If the value gap is real (your brokerage provides less value than the split premium over cloud models), you must either add value or adjust the split. Options: (a) introduce a cap that rewards production ($20K-$25K cap, then 95/5), (b) enhance technology and training to close the value gap, (c) create a tiered structure (new agents at 70/30 with heavy support, producing agents at 80/20 or capped), (d) add a revenue share or equity component.
5. Address the retention conversation: schedule 1:1 meetings with every remaining agent. Ask: "What would make you leave? What would make you stay?" The answers will reveal whether the problem is economics, culture, support, or leadership. Fix the actual problem, not the assumed one.
6. Model the brokerage P&L impact of split adjustments. If moving from 70/30 to 80/20 on 30 agents reduces company dollar by $150K, can the brokerage absorb that? What expense cuts or agent count increases would offset it? Present the math before making changes.

### Scenario 4: New Team Leader Designing Compensation Structure

**User says:** "I'm about to hire my first buyer's agent. What split should I offer? I provide all leads, CRM, TC, and training."

**Actions:**
1. Since the team provides leads, CRM, TC, and training, a 50/50 split on team-generated leads is standard and defensible. The team is providing the full infrastructure -- the agent brings production capacity and effort.
2. Recommend a dual-split structure: 50/50 on team-generated leads, 75/25 or 80/20 on agent-generated leads. This incentivizes the agent to build their own business while ensuring the team earns fair return on leads it paid for.
3. Address the agent-generated lead question proactively: allow and encourage it. Agents who are restricted from building their own book of business feel trapped and leave. Agents who can build their own pipeline on favorable splits while receiving team leads on fair splits stay and grow.
4. Build in a cap or graduated split to reward high production: after the agent closes 15 team-lead deals, improve the split to 55/45 or 60/40 for the remainder of the year. This retains top performers and creates a goal to work toward.
5. Model the economics: if the buyer's agent closes 12 deals at $8K average GCI on a 50/50 split, agent earns $48K and leader earns $48K. Leader subtracts lead cost (~$12K), TC allocation (~$5K), CRM/tech (~$3K), and training time (~$3K). Leader net: ~$25K. If the agent also closes 4 self-generated deals at $8K on an 80/20 split, agent adds $25.6K and leader adds $6.4K. Total agent income: ~$73.6K. Total leader net from this agent: ~$31.4K. Present this math clearly.
6. Cross-reference `commission-strategy` for the broader commission landscape and ensure the team's splits are competitive in the local market.

## Important Caveats

- **IC vs. employee classification varies by state and carries serious legal consequences.** Never classify a TC, ISA, or marketing coordinator as an independent contractor simply because it is cheaper. If the team controls their schedule, provides their tools, and directs their work, they are likely employees. Misclassification can result in back taxes, penalties, and lawsuits. Consult an employment attorney in your state before hiring. Varies by state -- verify with your state's labor department and real estate commission.
- **Team advertising rules vary by state and MLS.** Most states and MLSs require that team advertising include the brokerage name, the team leader's name, and appropriate licensing designations. Some states restrict the use of "team" in advertising entirely. Verify your state's specific requirements before branding or marketing a team.
- **Trust account management is governed by strict state regulations.** Mishandling earnest money or escrow funds can result in license revocation, fines, and personal liability. This skill provides general guidance -- always verify trust account requirements with your state's real estate commission and consider hiring a compliance consultant for brokerage-level operations.
- **This skill does not provide legal or employment law advice.** Compensation structures, IC agreements, employment contracts, and non-compete clauses involve legal considerations that require an attorney's review. Use this skill for business framework guidance, then validate with appropriate legal counsel.
- **Revenue share and stock programs from cloud brokerages are not guaranteed income.** See `brokerage-evaluator` for a rigorous analysis of these programs before using them as a recruiting tool or competitive counter-argument.
- **Team-building economics differ significantly by market and price point.** A team in a $200K average sale price market has fundamentally different economics than one in a $700K market. Always model with local commission rates and price points, not national averages.
- **This skill connects to `financial-performance` for team P&L modeling and tax implications, `business-planner` for scaling decisions and activity planning, `brokerage-evaluator` for understanding what agents evaluate when choosing teams and brokerages, and `onboarding-training` for structured new-agent onboarding programs.**
